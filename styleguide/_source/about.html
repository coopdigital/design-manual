    <p>The Co-op Style Guide forms the basis of the visual &amp; code style for digital projects. It is a work in progress and is based on the principals of <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" class="link-icon-right">Atomic Design.</a></p>

    <p>The Style Guide referrences all our common patterns so far. We have started out small, with what we know now.  We will be adding to the guide all the time as we design, build and test new elements. It will constantly change and involve based on real user behaviour.</p>
