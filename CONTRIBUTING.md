## Submitting a contribution

Any contribution to this repository should be done through a Pull Request (PR).

To create a Pull Request, first you need to isolate your work into a new branch:

```
git checkout -b new-branch
```

Once you have committed all your code to this branch, you can then push this branch to the repository:

```
git push -u origin new-branch
```

You can then open a Pull Request for the branch on this repository. Provide information about why the Pull Request is necessary (possibly referencing an issue listed in the issue tracker), list a summary of the changes introduced and any other information that may be relevant.

If necessary, CC the relevant users by adding `cc @username` at the end of the overview.
