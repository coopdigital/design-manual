                    <p>So, we design content to give users what they need:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>only when they need it</li>
                        <li>as simply and quickly as possible</li>
                        <li>using words they understand</li>
                        <li>in a consistent way</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Designing content that puts our users first makes it easier and faster for them to use our services, encourages them to interact with us again and builds trust in what we’re saying.</p>
                    <p>Before you start writing, you can use our digital content guidelines to think about what your users need and how your content can best meet those needs. You should also bear the Co-op tone of voice guidelines in mind, although we think if you’re writing clear content that meets your users’ needs, you’ll be writing in the right tone of voice anyway.</p>
                    <p>If you want advice on something that isn’t covered in this style guide or you want to suggest something we should add, contact content@coopdigital.co.uk.</p>
