                <h2>Step 1 &mdash; Identify what you need to learn as a team</h2>
                <p>Set aside an hour, get some post its and sharpies and book a room with a decent sized wall.</p>
                <p>Note: It can be useful to include stakeholders in this to help identify and understand their assumptions. It also makes them feel involved and bought into the process</p>
                <p>Give people 5-10 minutes to write down their questions and assumptions. (These questions are things the team need to learn, not questions they will ask users). For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>‘why are people visiting the Co-op website’</li>
                    <li>‘what are the main things people search for’</li>
                    <li>‘How do people use recipe websites’</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As a team, sort the post its into groups/themes.</p>
                <p>Add any new questions that crop us as you’re doing this.</p>
                <p>Refine the groups/themes down and summarise them.</p>
                <p>Give everyone 5 votes and ask them to vote for the questions they feel need answering most. Good prompts here can be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What scares you the most?</li>
                    <li>What are the biggest or riskiest assumptions we’re making?</li>
                    <li>What do we need to answer first before we can progress?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Document the things you need to learn however you want (one example available in <a href="https://trello.com/b/JPJaCnmo/research-tracker-example">Trello</a>) and move on to the next stage.</p>

                <h2>Step 2 &mdash; Sense check</h2>
                <p>Before planning or conducting any research, ask yourselves the following questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Do you need to do this research or do we or someone else already have the answer?</li>
                    <li>Are you committed to doing something with the findings?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you cannot answer ‘yes’ to both of these questions you should not being doing the research as it would be a waste of time, effort and resources for both the Co-op and the research participants. </p>
            </section>
            <section id="decide" class="coop-u-margin-bb coop-u-padding-bh">
                <h2>Step 3 &mdash; Decide how best to learn it</h2>
                <p>Decide on the most suitable way to answer the question you have that will give you enough confidence to help you make the decisions you need to make.</p>
                <p>Take into account the level of risk associated with the question vs the level of effort/cost required to conduct the research.</p>
                <p>For example, if you believe a change you can make is likely to improve the experience or solve a problem and the impact of getting it wrong is low, then <a href="/user-research/analysing-and-using-findings.html">document a hypothesis</a>, put it live and monitor it closely &mdash; you can always revert back if it’s unsuccessful. You don’t need to usability test everything.</p>
                <p>Feel free to ask a member of the user research team for advice if you aren’t sure of the best approach to take or of how to use the method.</p>
