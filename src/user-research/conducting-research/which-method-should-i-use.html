                <h2>Usability testing</h2>
                <p>Watching people use the service, often by asking them to complete certain tasks or find certain information and asking them questions regarding their experiences.</p>
                <p>Testing can be done in several ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lab based &mdash; recruiting and then bringing in users to the research lab in Federation</li>
                    <li>Remote moderated &mdash; recruiting and testing with people over Skype, hangouts etc</li>
                    <li>Pop up testing &mdash; visit a library or coffee shop and ask people to have a go at the service</li>
                    <li>Remote unmoderated &mdash; using <a href="https://www.whatusersdo.com/">whatusersdo.com</a> to set up a remote, unmoderated test that is issued to users via What Users Do. You’ll receive videos of the users completing the task within 24 hours</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Good for</h3>
                <p>Understanding the experience of users, identifying problems and areas for improvement. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of competitors.</p>
                <h3>Cost</h3>
                <p>Varies from the cost of incentives for pop up testing to up to &pound;2000 for a lab session with 5 recruited participants.</p>
                <h3>Timescales</h3>
                <p>0 days for pop up through to roughly 2 weeks for a recruited lab session.</p>
                <h3>Difficulty</h3>
                <p>Lab based and remote: hard</p>
                <p>Pop up: medium</p>
                <p>Unmoderated: easy</p>
