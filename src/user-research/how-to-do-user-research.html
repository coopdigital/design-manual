                <h2>Decide on an approach</h2>
                <p>The scale of research and the type of research will vary dependent on the type of project and the stage the project is at. For example, the Co-op Web Team are currently looking at the recipes on the Co-op food website User research could take:</p>
                <h3>A wide approach</h3>
                <p>Conduct interviews or diary studies with a variety of people to understand how people plan meals, cook and feed themselves and their family and design a whole new service or approach to support those needs.</p>
                <h3>A narrow approach</h3>
                <p>Analyse web analytics and potentially usability testing the current pages and then improve the existing designs to make them more usable.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="identify" class="coop-u-margin-bb coop-u-padding-bh">
                <h2>Identify what you need to learn</h2>
                <p>1. Set aside an hour, get some post its and sharpies and book a room with a decent sized wall.</p>
                <p>Note: It can be useful to include stakeholders in this to help identify and understand down their assumptions. It also makes them feel involved.</p>
                <p>2. Each person spends 5-10 minutes writing down their questions and assumptions. (These questions are things the team need to learn, not questions they will ask users). For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>‘why are people visiting the Co-op website’</li>
                    <li>‘what are the main things people search for’</li>
                    <li>‘How do people use recipe websites’</li>
                </ul>
                <p>3. As a team, sort the post its into groups/themes.</p>
                <p>4. Add new questions as required.</p>
                <p>5. Refine these down and summarise them.</p>
                <p>6. Give everyone 5 votes and ask them to vote for the questions they feel need answering most. Good prompts here can be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What scares you the most?</li>
                    <li>What are the biggest or riskiest assumptions we’re making?</li>
                    <li>What do we need to answer first before we can progress?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Document the things you need to learn however you want (one example below) and move on to the next stage.</p>

            <section id="check" class="coop-u-margin-bb coop-u-padding-bh">
                <h2>Sense check</h2>
                <p>Before planning or conducting any research, ask yourselves the following questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Do you need to do this research or do we or someone else already have the answer?</li>
                    <li>Are you committed to doing something with the findings?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you cannot answer ‘yes’ to both of these questions you should not being doing the research as it would be a waste of time, effort and resources for both the Co-op and the research participants.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="decide" class="coop-u-margin-bb coop-u-padding-bh">
                <h2>Decide how best to learn it</h2>
                <p>Decide on the most suitable way to answer the question you have that will give you enough confidence to help you make the decisions you need to make.
                <p>Take into account the level of risk associated with the question vs the level of effort/cost required to conduct the research.</p>
                <p>For example, if you believe a change you can make is likely to improve the experience or solve a problem and the impact of getting it wrong is low, then document a hypothesis, put it live and monitor it closely- you can always revert back if it’s unsuccessful. You don’t need to usability test everything.</p>
                <p>Feel free to ask a member of the user research team for advice if you aren’t sure of the best approach to take or of how to use the method.</p>
                <p>What do you want to know?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I want to quantify a need or problem</li>
                    <li>Another type of question</li>
                    <li>Another type of question</li>
