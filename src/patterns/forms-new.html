        <h3>Know why you’re asking each question and what it’s needed for</h3>
        <p>Before you ask a user to answer a question, make sure that you know exactly how you will use the answer and why the answer is necessary for the service. If it’s not necessary, do not ask. The more you ask of the user, the more effort it takes them and the more likely they are to drop out of the service.</p>
        <h3>Tell users why we’re asking</h3>
        <p>When you ask for information tell users why we are asking for it and what we’ll do with it. This will not only increase trust but can affect the answer a user gives. For example, asking someone for an address to verify who they are,  and asking for an address to deliver something to, could result in different responses from the user.[could show wills address example?]</p>
        <h3>Use simple, direct language</h3>
        <p>Do not burden a user with new terminology and concepts if you can avoid it. It increases the effort it takes the user to get through the form, and makes it more likely that they’ll stop using it and go elsewhere.</p>
        <p>If the answer the user needs to give relies on their understanding of a complex concept, you must explain in plain English [wills executor example?].  Do not assume any prior knowledge of the subject you’re writing about. Do not assume a certain level of literacy, education or digital experience. Design for everyone[link to principle].</p>
        <p>Even if you’re writing for a specialist audience, <a href="#">research shows that the higher the level of expertise the greater the preference for plain English.</a></p>
        <p>Content that’s easy to understand benefits everyone.</p>
        <h3>Give information in context</h3>
        <p>Think about the most effective place for your user to get information. A website is not always the best channel.</p>
        <p>Content should be timely: given at the point it’s needed. Do not give information within a form that a user needs to refer to at a later date. And do not disturb the task the user is completing – the form — by including a link within it that takes the user away from it.</p>
        <h3>Get information in context</h3>
        <p>If the user needs to understand complex information in order to answer a question, give that information at the point it’s needed.  Allow users to easily refer back to it, re-read it or skip to parts they’re unsure of.  Consider users who have short term memory, cognitive problems or are in a distracting environment — don’t expect complex information to be retained easily or for a long time. Make complex questions as easy as possible for your users to answer. <a href="#">See how the Wills Team tried to make writing a will less daunting.</a></p>
        <p>And let users focus — only deal with one concept per page.</p>
        <h3>Set expectations</h3>
        <p>Tell users what’s expected of them before they start the form. It will reduce frustration and make it less likely that they’ll drop out of the transaction.</p>
        <p>Tell users upfront:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>what the service is</li>
            <li>what the eligibility is</li>
            <li>what information they need which they may not have immediately to hand</li>
            <li>any related costs or commitments</li>
            <li>any other essential information that may affect their decision to use your service</li>

        <h3>Radio buttons and checkboxes</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column medium-7 small-12">
                <p>Radio buttons and checkboxes allow users to select an answer from 2 or more options.</p>
                <p>Use radio buttons when the user can choose only one answer from a list.</p>
                <p>Use checkboxes when the user can choose multiple answers from a list.</p>
                <p>If you’re using either radio buttons or checkboxes, you must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>style them in a way that makes it clear which option or options has been selected</li>

                    <li>display the options a user can choose from top to bottom, not left to right — this makes it quicker for users to scan</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Where possible, give users the option to indicate that none of the options apply to them. Some users need this to be an explicit option to know that they can move on.</p>

        <h3>Text entry fields</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column large-7">
                <p>If you need your user to type information into your form, use a text entry field.</p>
                <p>If you’re using text entry field, you must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>give them a label: ‘Full name’, ‘Date of birth’, ‘Address’ and so on  [link to labelling elements]</li>
                    <li>allow users to click on the label to let them to start answer (clicking the label takes the cursor to the text entry field)</li>
                    <li>don’t use placeholder text (text that sits within the form field) — if a question needs extra clarification, use hint text instead</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Types of text entry field</h3>
                <p>Depending on the answer you’re expecting, use either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a one line entry box (known as a ‘text input’) for things like name, email and so on</li>
                    <li>multiple line entry box (known as ‘text area’) for things like feedback, additional information and so on</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Text input</h3>
                <p>With a text input you must also make the length of the box appropriate for the amount of information needed: do not make it frustratingly short or intimidatingly long.</p>
                <p>Example date of birth - with hint text, not placeholder</p>
                <h3>Text area</h3>
                <p>Use large text areas with caution. Many users find it hard to type, do not like to type or worry about articulating themselves. Large text areas can be daunting and discouraging.</p>
                <p>If you have reason to use them, research them with mobile device users.  Entering information using touch devices can be especially time-consuming.</p>
                <p>Text areas should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>scale appropriately on mobile devices</li>
                    <li>be a size that allows the user to scroll outside of it</li>
                    <li>have ‘draggable’ corners so users can control the size of the text area</li>
                    <li>show a countdown of remaining characters (if you’re restricting the characters that can be typed in the text area)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Drop down lists (also known as ‘select inputs’) can be hard to use because they:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>hide content from the user</li>
                    <li>can slow users down</li>
                    <li>are less accessible than other options</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are alternatives to using a drop down list. Try:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>checkboxes or radio buttons for short lists</li>
                    <li>type aheads (the user is offered a list of relevant suggestions as they type), such as <a href="#">Baymard's Country Selector,</a> for  longer lists such as country and county lists</li>
                    <li>text entry fields if you do not need the answer to be matched with a back-end system</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Only use a drop down lists if you have  thorough research to support your decision.</p>

        <h3>Asking for name and title</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column large-7">
                <p>Only ask for name and title if it’s essential.The format of people’s names can vary. Some do not fit into conventional UK formats. It can be unnecessary and uncomfortable for users to define themselves using a title, or a separate first name — surname format.</p>
                <p>Never gather a title to assume gender.</p>
                <p>Find out <a href="#">how we ask for names and titles.</a></p>
                <h3>Asking for gender and sex</h3>
                <p>Don’t ask.</p>
                <p>As with gathering a ‘title’, some users may feel uneasy giving this information.</p>
                <p>If you do need to know, ask about a person’s ‘gender’, not their sex. Allow them to tell us in their own words with a text entry field</p>
                <p>If you’re gathering information to use it to address the user later, ask what pronoun they prefer - he/him, she/her, they/them.</p>
                <p>But ultimately - if you do not need to know - do not ask.</p>
                <h3>Validation</h3>
                <p>We should be building services that are flexible enough to allow users to give data in a way that they would naturally. For example we should allow users to enter a postcode in upper or lower case, with or without a space.</p>
                <p>Validation errors should only be triggered on mandatory fields. They must be factual and help the user move on.  [Link to content style guide]</p>
                <p>Example wills personal details validation</p>
                <h3>Address</h3>
                <p>Only ask for a user’s postal address if it is essential information we need to fulfil the service. Telling users how you will use their address may affect their answer: their delivery address may be different to an address we need to verify their identity.</p>
                <p>Example address details in wills</p>
                <h3>Progressive reveals</h3>
                <p>You might need to ask users for more information because of how they answered a previous question. You can use a ‘progressive reveal’ to do this so you only show the extra form field to the users who need to see it.</p>
                <p>Only use progressive reveals to ask for one piece of information. If you need to ask for more than one thing, do so on a separate screen.</p>
                <p>Example wills choosing executors</p>
                <h3>Multi-page forms</h3>
                <p>Only ask users for one type of information on screen at a time. This helps to keep them focused and makes the purpose of each page clear.</p>
                <h3>Continue and back</h3>
                <p>Allow users to move through the form with a ‘continue’ button and a ‘back’ link. Make the continue button the primary button on the page to encourage users to progress through the form.</p>
                <p>Position your continue button on the bottom left of the page so it’s easier for users to see.</p>
                <p>‘Continue’ buttons should always be active. If a user tries to progress without completing the necessary information, run [validation messages] to tell your user what the error is and how to fix it.</p>
                <p>Reference GDS material on this?</p>
                <h3>Progress trackers</h3>
                <p>A progress tracker gives your users an indication of how far through a form they are. But they can be more problematic than helpful — they can get in the way and confuse users.</p>
                <p>Only use a progress tracker if you have thorough research to support the decision.</p>
