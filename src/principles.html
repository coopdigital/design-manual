            <h1>Principles</h1>
            <p>Our digital design principles reflect how we think about design and provide way for us to look at the work we create and how we create it: building the right thing; building the thing right.</p>

            <h2>We design in context</h2>
            <p>Communicating with a clear voice, at the right time, in the right.&nbsp;way.</p>
            <p>We do this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>understanding user needs, the market, technology and our business&nbsp;goals</li>
                <li>looking at the whole experience for the user, not just the digital&nbsp;part</li>
                <li>giving information only at the point it’s needed, and through the most effective&nbsp;channel</li>

            <h2>We design with purpose</h2>
            <p>Making services that are useful, elegant and easy to&nbsp;use.</p>
            <p>We’re doing this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>knowing why the service is needed before we build&nbsp;it</li>
                <li>measuring and challenging the effectiveness of what we&nbsp;build</li>
                <li>getting out of the way - helping users achieve their goals as quickly as they&nbsp;can</li>
                <li>designing services that speak for themselves - they’re self-explanatory and&nbsp;intuitive </li>

            <h2>We design for everyone</h2>
            <p>Designing so that no one feels different.</p>
            <p>We do this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>communicating in a clear, simple way; opening up our services to&nbsp;everyone</li>
                <li>designing for people irrespective of their background, circumstance, digital skills or subject knowledge - removing any barriers to our&nbsp;services</li>
                <li>recognising that people come to our services with their own needs, insecurities and struggles – they deserve our consideration and&nbsp;thoughtfulness</li>

            <p>We do this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>being truthful about what we can and cannot do for our&nbsp;users</li>
                <li>talking about what we’ve done, not what we’ve yet to&nbsp;do</li>

            <ul>
                <li>talking about what we’re making as we make&nbsp;it</li>
                <li>being generous with what we know, and open to learning from&nbsp;others</li>

            <ul>
                <li>releasing earlier, learning&nbsp;faster</li>
                <li>learning from what people do, not what they say they&nbsp;do</li>
