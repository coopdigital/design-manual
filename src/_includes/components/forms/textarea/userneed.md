<p>If you're using text areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>scale them appropriately on mobile devices</li>
    <li>allow the user to scroll outside of them on touch screen devices</li>
    <li>allow users to control the size of the text area by giving it ‘draggable’ corners</li>
    <li>show a countdown of remaining characters (if you’re restricting the characters that can be entered in the text area)</li>
</ul>
