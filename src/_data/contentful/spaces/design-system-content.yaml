  title: Textarea
  status: live
  introduction: Textareas are for when users need to provide longer responses. Use
    with caution.
  design_and_content_documentation: |-
    Use large text areas with caution. Many users find it hard to type, do not like to type or worry about articulating themselves. Large text areas can be daunting and discouraging.

    If you have reason to use them, research them using mobile devices. Entering information using touch devices can be especially time-consuming.

  title: Responsive tables
  status: beta
  introduction: |-
    Patterns used for making a table responsive should be appropriate to the data in the table and how users are looking at that data.

    This ‘rows become mini-tables’ approach works for a table with different types of values — including text.
  design_and_content_documentation: |-
    The responsive table takes the same style as the main table — but differ under 480px by the:

    - heading rows becoming table headers
    - table cell borders are removed

    For the styles to work correctly, you must match the markup structure in the example. When deciding whether to use this solution think carefully about if it will fit the needs of your users. If in doubt don't use it, or build your own responsive table. We have made this solution as simple as possible and cannot varify its accessibility yet on smaller device size. Please research your service with users of all abilities.

  title: Colour palette
  status: live
  introduction: |-
    You can use other colours to:

    - draw users’ focus to particular content areas
    - emphasise content so that it’s read in an order that makes sense to users
    - give the impression of depth and layering — this can help structure content in a helpful way for users
  design_and_content_documentation: |
    These colours have been contrast tested as background colours with white or grey (#282828) text. Use a colour contrast checker when using any other colour of text.

    Use Co-op’s colour palette:

    - to draw users’ focus to particular content areas
    - to give emphasis, depth and highlight to our work where needed
    - in the right context — for example don’t use large amounts of colour in a form, it can distract the user
    - with restraint — users can read content better when we use limited colour
    - to help convey meaning to interaction patterns, for example, for mandatory form fields. Never use colour alone to do this.
    - to communicate the Co-op brand — see the brand guidelines

    The Co-op brand blue is only used on the Co‑op logo. Never use brand blue as text or as a background colour — it’s difficult for those with low vision to read on screen.
  accessibility_documentation: |-
    Think about how your colour choices can affect legibility and accessibility — [read WCAG 2.0 specifications on using colour](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0#use-of-color). To be legible, text and background colours must have a minimum contrast between them. You can check colour contrasts online using:

    - [Web Aim's Colour Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
    - [Color Oracle (free colour blindness simulator)](http://colororacle.org/)
    - As well as using these tools, test colour contrast with people of all abilities.

    If you have a question about colour, contact [design@coopdigital.co.uk](mailto:design@coopdigital.co.uk).

  title: Quotations
  status: live
  introduction: "Quotations highlight and support points within content. \n\nUsually
    quotes come from someone with experience or authority in a subject area. It could
    be an expert or someone who has used a product or service. \n\nIf you’re using
    them on a digital platform you need to make sure that they are going to help the
    user do what they came to do. \n"
  design_and_content_documentation: "Use quotations when you:\n- want to refer to
    what someone said, not to pull out text written within the page copy\n- are referring
    to an external source - remember to cite the author and if possible link to their
    original work\n- are knowingly using a jargon word after giving a plain English
    description, for example, 'the people you want to sort out your will (known as
    'executors')'   \n\nOur quotations use hanging punctuation when using this pattern.
    This means the opening quotation mark must sit in the margin so as not to disrupt
    the flow (left alignment) of the text. If the quote is within the text (on the
    same line) it would not hang.\n\nWhen marking up quotes in HTML - use true quotation
    marks. True quotes are called smart quotes and the right one must be used according
    to whether you are opening (‘) or closing (’) a quotation. [Find out about HTML
    character codes to use for quotes.](https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/punctuation/)\n"
  accessibility_documentation: |-
    Our quotations are marked up with the blockquote element (for the quotation text) and the cite element for referring to the author of the quote.
    According to the W3C, the “blockquote element represents a section that is quoted from another source.” So,  when you use this pattern, do not to use it to refer to text within the same page.
  variations: 'As in the example above - you can use larger text for the quotation
    if the text is shorter.

  introduction: We use a grid to structure our designs. Just like the typography and
    vertical spacing we use, our grid allows the creation of a consistent horizontal
    space.
  design_and_content_documentation: |-
    Our grid has 12 columns that can be used in various combinations. It has gutters of 32px above 768px and 16px below 768px. We recommend its use because it has been designed to suit our typographic scale.

    The default widths (breakpoints) we use are:

    - All: 0px and up — (all-{column-span})
    - Extra small: 320px and up — (.xsmall-{column-span})
    - Small: 480px and up — ((.small-{column-span})

  title: Tables
  status: live
  introduction: Tables are a good way to present large amounts of complex information
    when the user needs to compare different things or or interrogate that information.
    The table format is familiar and, when done well, helps people to find answers
    to questions.
  accessibility_documentation: "### Captions\nA caption is the heading for a table.
    Most screen readers announce the content of captions. Captions help users to find
    a table and understand what it’s about and decide if they want to read it. The
    caption is provided by the &lt;caption&gt; element.\n\n### Headers and footers\nBoth
    columns and rows of a table can have headings. These are marked up as &lt;th&gt;
    (table heading). We also use the &lt;thead&gt;and &lt;tbody&gt; tags. Although
    these are not technically needed in all tables, they add some semantic value and
    are useful if a table needs to be printed as the &lt;thead&gt; element is repeated
    across all printed pages.\n  \nTable footers (&lt;tfoot&gt;) can be used if there
    is a lot of rows in a table. It will be displayed by a browser under the body
    content, but in the markup must be above it. If you have to support a very old
    browser test this display as in some older browsers it is displayed before the
    body. In this case move it to below the table content.\n\n### Row headings\nWhen
    a row needs a heading the &lt;td&gt; of that row should be marked up as a &lt;th&gt;.\n\n###
    Scope\nWhen the data that relates to the headings is ambiguous the attribute scope=&#x201C;col&#x201D;
    or scope=&#x201C;row&#x201D; should be added. The scope attribute defines the
    direction of the header cells and associates them with the corresponding data
    cells. The scope attribute is also needed for larger tables with one header row
    or column. We recommend always defining the scope of your column or row headings.\n
    \ \n### Top left cell\nThe top left cell of a table is often blank as there is
    no overarching header for the row headings and the content of the table has been
    described by the &lt;caption&gt;. This cell can be left blank, but must be marked
    up as an empty &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;.\n"

  title: Checkboxes and radios
  status: live
  introduction: Radio buttons and checkboxes allow users to select an answer from
    2 or more options.
  design_and_content_documentation: |-
    If you’re using either radio buttons or checkboxes:

    - style them in a way that makes it clear which option or options has been selected
    - allow users to click anywhere in the box
    - display the options a user can choose from top to bottom, not left to right — this makes it quicker for users to scan
    - Where possible, give users the option to indicate that none of the options apply to them. Some users need this to be an explicit option to know that they can move on.

  title: Content design style guide
  introduction: |-
    We write content for the user, not for us.

    So, we design content to give users what they need:

    - only when they need it
    - as simply and quickly as possible
    - using words they understand
    - in a consistent way

    We design in context.

    Designing content that puts our users first makes it easier and faster for them to use our services, encourages them to interact with us again and builds trust in what we’re saying.

  content: "## [Asking for names](#asking-for-names)\n\nOnly ask for someone's name
    if it's essential: design with purpose.\n\nIf it is, and you can justify the reason
    you're asking:\n\n- ask for a ‘Full name’ in one field\n- make no assumptions
    about how the user wants to be addressed — ask them\n- make it explicit whose
    name we’re asking for — include who the other person is if you’re capturing multiple
    names in one form, for example, ‘Your child’s full name’\n- give an accurate instruction
    if the name needs to be written as it appears on another document, for example,
    ‘Copy the name from your passport’\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"column
    large-8\">\n    <h3 class=\"example-heading\"><span class=\"example_label\">Example</span></h3>\n
    \   <div class=\"example example--padded\">\n      <div class=\"form-row\">\n
    \       <label for=\"full-name\">Full name</label>\n        <input id=\"full-name\"
    type=\"text\">\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"form-row\">\n        <label for=\"childs-full-name\">Your
    child’s full name</label>\n        <input id=\"childs-full-name\" type=\"text\">\n
    \     </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nIf you you have to capture name
    in separate fields, perhaps because of a legacy system, use:\n\n- ‘First name
    or names’, ‘Middle name’ (if necessary) and ‘Last name’\n- a free text box if
    you have to ask for title\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"column large-12\">\n
    \   <h3 class=\"example-heading\"><span class=\"example_label\">Example</span></h3>\n
    \   <div class=\"example example--padded\">\n      <div class=\"row\">\n        <div
    class=\"column large-2\">\n          <div class=\"form-row\">\n            <label
    for=\"title\">Title</label>\n            <input id=\"title\" type=\"text\">\n
    \         </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"column large-5\">\n          <div
    class=\"form-row\">\n            <label for=\"first-name\">First name or names</label>\n
    \           <input id=\"first-name\" type=\"text\">\n          </div>\n        </div>\n

    \         </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n##
    [Brackets ('parentheses')](#brackets) \n### Round brackets\nUse round brackets
    to:\n\n- clarify an acronym or technical term that you’ll use from that point
    onwards, for example: ‘Customer team member (CTM)’, or ‘the people you want to
    sort out your will (known as 'executors')'\n- include supplementary information
    that’s not essential to the main point of your sentence – information that, if
    removed, would not change the meaning of the sentence\n\nDo not use round brackets
    to indicate that something can be singular or plural, like:\n\n‘Check which document(s)
    you need to send to HR’\n\nInstead, use the plural, as this will cover each possibility:
    ‘Check which documents you need to send to HR .’\n\n(A complete sentence that
    stands alone in parentheses starts with a capital letter and ends with a full
    stop before the closing bracket.)'\n\nTry not to overuse brackets, they can disrupt
    the flow of reading.\n\n### Square brackets\nOnly use square brackets to when
    you need to add clarification to a quote or something you've not written yourself,
    like:\n\n\"It [content] deserves our full time and attention\".\n\n## [Using Co-op](#using-co-op)
    \nRefer to Co‑op as a noun in writing as ‘Co‑op’, and not (where possible/practical)
    as ‘the Co‑op’.\n\nWe know that users tend to refer to our food stores as ‘the
    Co‑op’, so dropping the ‘the’ avoids any confusion.\n\nMake sure you use a non-breaking
    hyphen using &#8209;. This will ensure the word ‘Co‑op’ does not break when it
    appears at the end of a line.\n\nRefer to our business units as Co‑op Funeralcare,
    Co‑op Digital etc. (Two words, both capitalised.)\n\nWhen we're talking about
    our organisation in terms of what we do, it's fine to use Co‑op as an adjective,
    as in 'Co‑op values'.\n\nNo need to capitalise 'Co‑operative' when it appears
    as an adjective or a noun unless you are referring to the Co‑operative Group.\n\nHowever,
    do not talk about 'the Group' to an external audience. It doesn't mean anything
    to anyone outside Co‑op.\n\nUsing 'our' as in 'our Co‑op' can be powerful but
    use with caution - is it clear who 'our' is? Will 'our' mean the same thing to
    your reader as it does to you? It’s more suited to an internal audience.\n\n'Co‑operative'
    and ‘Co‑op’ are always hyphenated.\n\nThe only exception to this rule is on social
    media when using a hashtag such as #TheCoopWay or #BeingCoop.\n\n## [Dates and
    times](#dates-and-times)\nThe following guidance on dates and times is taken from
    gov.uk:\n\n### Dates\nAs a general rule, dates should be capitalised and written
    out in full like this:\n\n‘1 January 2018’\n\nBut if you’re limited with space,
    such as creating a table, then ‘Jan’, ‘Feb’ and so on is fine.\n\nDon't use ordinal
    numbers for dates like 10th, 1st and so on. It's easy to get wrong and uses more
    characters.\n\nIf you’re referring to date ranges, then use ‘to’ rather than hyphens,
    en rules or em dashes.\n\nIt should look like this: January to March\n\nAvoid
    all references to annual quarters. Instead, write the dates in full:\n\n‘This
    offer is valid between 1 October 2018 and 31 December 2018.’\n\n### Times\nUse
    the 12 hour clock. It’s easier to understand and helps avoids confusion:\n\n‘Monday
    to Friday, 9am to 5pm.’\n\nIf you need to include minutes, write it like this:\n\n‘9.15am’\n\nUse
    ‘midday’ rather than noon, 12noon, or 12pm.\n\nFor example: ‘This store closes
    24 December, midday.’\n\nUse ‘midnight’ rather 12am, but be careful that it’s
    not misleading. For example, if I said:\n\n‘Please complete and send your application
    form by 6 July 2018, at midnight’\n\nThen you might wonder if I meant ‘ 6 July
    2018, 11.59pm’ or ‘5 July 2018, 11.59pm’\n\nTo avoid this confusion, consider
    using ‘11.59pm’ where possible.\n\nIt’s not necessary to specify time zones, such
    as ‘1pm GMT’.\n\n## [Colons and semicolons](#colons-and-semicolons)\nUse a colon
    at the end of a lead-in line to a bulleted list, for example:\n\nYou need to bring:\n\n-
    your driving licence or passport\n- a copy of your P60\n- something else\n\nIf
    you use a colon to continue or explain an idea that you mention before the colon,
    consider whether it would be better to have 2 sentences or an em dash.\n\nAvoid
    using semicolons — they can make sentences long and hard-to-read. If you think
    a sentence needs a semicolon, break it into separate sentences.\n\n## [Ellipsis](#ellipsis)\n\nEllipsis
    are 3 dots that should only be used when:\n\n- you’re quoting someone and need
    to show words have been missed out — only do this is the meaning will not be changed,
    for example: “We're building things that are user-centric… doing the hard work
    centrally to make things clearer, simpler and quicker.\"\n- to indicate there's
    more to come, for example, in a header: 'We asked our users to name a wine…’\n\nIf
    you use ellipsis, use 3 dots only. They should follow straight on after the previous
    word (with no space), and have one space after.\n\nIf the ellipsis ends the sentence,
    do not add an additional full stop.\n\nIf you’re putting an ellipsis in html use
    &hellip;.\n\n\n## [Frequently asked questions (FAQs)](#faqs)\n\nDo not use FAQs.\n\nInstead,
    if you know that you are answering a genuine frequently asked question, restructure
    your content so that the answers form part of the main user journey. And put the
    information in a logical place in that journey.\n\nWe do not use FAQs because:\n\n-
    users do not know if their question has been frequently asked\n- they're often
    made up by the business rather than genuinely asked by the public\n- users have
    to navigate through irrelevant content to see if their question is there — it’s
    frustrating and wastes their time\n- we should be creating services that speak
    for themselves: [we design with purpose](https://coop-design-manual.herokuapp.com/principles.html#purpose)\n-
    \nFor more information read [Content Strategist Sarah Richards' blog on FAQs](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/07/25/faqs-why-we-dont-have-them/).\n\n##
    [Hyphens and dashes](hyphens-and-dashes)\n\nWhat you’re writing will determine
    where and when you should use hyphens and dashes.\n\nHyphens (the character you
    get when you type ‘-’ ) should be used to link words or part of words — they show
    the user that there’s a connection between them, for example, ‘mother-in-law’,
    ‘fine-tuned’, ‘Co‑op’.\n\nEn dashes (&ndash;) should be used for connecting things
    that are related to each other by distance such as June–July.\n\nEm dashes (&mdash;)
    can be used in pairs like parenthesis — that is, to enclose a word, or a phrase
    — or they can be used alone to detach one end of a sentence from the main body.\n\n##
    [Job titles](job-titles)\nShould only be capitalised when associated with a name
    - otherwise lower case.\n\nFor example: Chief Executive Mary Smith, a boatload
    of chief executives.\n\n## [Links](links)\n\nA link should be descriptive of the
    place it's taking the user. Do not use text such as ‘click here’, or anything
    that does not make sense when read out of context — screen readers can read link
    text in isolation without the surrounding content.\n\nLink text must:\n\n- tell
    the user where it’s taking them\n- be action orientated, for example, ‘Choose…’,
    ‘Find…’, ‘Discover…’\n- not include a title tag — this accessibility feature is
    not used any more as it’s not that helpful for visually impaired people\n- tell
    the user if they’re leaving our site, for example, ‘For more information visit
    [www.citizensadvice.org.uk](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk)’\n- use a full
    url if it’s clean (no symbols), short and potentially easy to remember (max one
    / ) for example: [bbc.co.uk/sport](https://bbc.co.uk/sport) — otherwise, if there’s
    a complex url, use a ‘word’ link\n\nWhen you are linking to another page or an
    external site, think about your user‘s onward journey. If the page you’re linking
    to opens in:\n\n- the same window, your user may lose their place in the information
    flow\n- a different window, your user may find it difficult to navigate back to
    your site\n- Use this to consider how and where to position your links.\n\n##
    [Lists](lists)\n### Bullet lists\n\nBullets must:\n\n- use a lead-in line\n- make
    sense running on from the lead-in line\n- use lower case at the start of the bullet\n-
    have only one sentence per bullet point — use commas, dashes or semicolons to
    expand on an item\n\nBullets should not:\n\n- be paragraphs masquerading as a
    list for a visual effect\n- use a full stop after the last bullet point\n- include
    ‘or’ or an ‘and’ after the bullets\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"column
    medium-7 small-12\">\n    <h3 class=\"example-heading\"><span class=\"example_label\">Example</span></h3>\n
    \   <div class=\"example example--padded\">\n      <h4>The meeting agenda will
    be:</h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li>an overview of the last month</li>\n        <li>a
    presentation</li>\n        <li>a special announcement</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n
    \ </div>\n</div>\n\n\n### Numbered lists\n\nUse a numbered list for a logical
    sequence of things, like a series of tasks that must be done in a certain order.
    They do not need a lead-in line and should be complete sentences that start with
    a capital letter and end with a full stop.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"column
    medium-7 small-12\">\n    <h3 class=\"example-heading\"><span class=\"example_label\">Example</span></h3>\n
    \   <div class=\"example example--padded\">\n      <h4>How to put your shoes on:</h4>\n
    \     <ol>\n        <li>Put on socks.</li>\n        <li>Put on shoes.</li>\n        <li>Tie
    laces.</li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n## [Money](money)\n\nUse
    the £ symbol: £75\n\nCurrencies are lower case.\n\nWrite out pence in full: calls
    will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline.\n\nDon’t use decimals unless pence
    are included: £75.50 but not £75.00\n\nCheck the advice about numbers and units
    for amounts over 1,000.\n\n## [Numbers and units](numbers-and-units)\n\nUse ‘one’
    unless you’re talking about a step, a point in a list or another situation where
    using the numeral makes more sense.\n\nWrite all numbers in numerals (including
    2 to 9) except where it’s part of a common expression and it would look strange,
    like ‘one or two of them’.\n\nIf a number starts a sentence, write it out in full
    (‘Thirty-four hula-hoops found in researcher’s filing cupboard’) except where
    it starts a title or subheading.\n\nFor numerals over 999, insert a comma for
    clarity. For example, ‘It was over 1,000’.\n\nSpell out common fractions, such
    as one-half.\n\nUse a % sign for percentages: 50%, not ‘pc’ or ‘percent’.\n\nUse
    a 0 where there’s no digit before the decimal point.\n\nIn tables, use numerals
    throughout (not written numbers).\n\nFor big numbers use ‘million’, ‘billion’
    and so on, written without a space after the number — for example, £3.5million.\n\n###
    Ordinal numbers: first, second and so on\n\nSpell out 'first' to 'ninth'. After
    that use 10th, 11th and so on.\n\nBut, write dates as 10 January 2017.\n\n###
    Units\n\nUse MB not KB for anything over 1MB, for example 4.09MB not 4096KB.\n\nFor
    anything under 1MB, use KB, for example, 569KB not 0.55MB.\n\nKeep units as accurate
    as possible and up to 2 decimal places. For example, 4.03MB.\n\n## [Dates and
    times](dates-and-times)\nThe following guidance on dates and times is taken from
    gov.uk:\n\n### Dates\n\nAs a general rule, dates should be capitalised and written
    out in full like this:\n\n‘1 January 2018’\n\nBut if you’re limited with space,
    such as creating a table, then ‘Jan’, ‘Feb’ and so on is fine.\n\nDon't use ordinal
    numbers for dates like 10th, 1st and so on. It's easy to get wrong and uses more
    characters.\n\nIf you’re referring to date ranges, then use ‘to’ rather than hyphens,
    en rules or em dashes.\n\nIt should look like this: January to March\n\nAvoid
    all references to annual quarters. Instead, write the dates in full:\n\n‘This
    offer is valid between 1 October 2018 and 31 December 2018.’\n\n### Times\n\nUse
    the 12 hour clock. It’s easier to understand and helps avoids confusion:\n\n‘Monday
    to Friday, 9am to 5pm.’\n\nIf you need to include minutes, write it like this:\n\n‘9.15am’\n\nUse
    ‘midday’ rather than noon, 12noon, or 12pm.\n\nFor example: ‘This store closes
    24 December, midday.’\n\nUse ‘midnight’ rather than 12am, but be careful that
    it’s not misleading. For example, if I said:\n\n‘Please complete and send your
    application form by 6 July 2018, at midnight’\n\nThen you might wonder if I meant
    ‘ 6 July 2018, 11.59pm’ or ‘5 July 2018, 11.59pm’\n\nTo avoid this confusion,
    consider using ‘11.59pm’ where possible.\n\nIt’s not necessary to specify time
    zones, such as ‘1pm GMT’.\n\n## [Phone numbers](phone-numbers)\n\nShow a mobile
    phone number like this: 08765 555 333.\n\nShow a UK landline number like this:
    0161 000 0000 or 01524 000 000.\n\nShow an overseas number as you'd dial it from
    the UK, so no + or (0): 00 353 1 222 3333.\n\nRemember:\n- include call charges\n-
    include opening hours\n- make sure phone numbers are usable from mobiles\n\n##
    [Titles](titles)\n\nTitles should:\n- be sentence case\n- be less than 65 characters
    within HTML document titles — Google cuts them off after this\n- be unique, clear
    and descriptive — no puns or single topic words\n- be front-loaded with key words
    if possible — people tend to scan the first couple of words only\n- use words
    you know your users actually search for\n- be active where possible, ‘Apply for…’,
    ‘Report…’, ‘Find…’\n- not use acronyms unless they are well-known, like EU, BBC.\n\n##
    [Validation messages](validation-messages)\n\nValidation messages must:\n\n- be
    flagged at the top of the screen and at each relevant field\n- be a bulleted list
    if there’s more than one error\n- be a complete sentence if there’s only one error
    (no bullet)\n- be linked from the top of the page to take users to the relevant
    field\n- help the user fix the problem, for example, ‘Check you've entered the
    correct sort code — it’s the 6 digit number usually found on your bank card’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
