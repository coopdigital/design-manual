    A tag may link to another page, for example a category page for vegan recipes,
    red wine, or Fair Trade.
  design_and_content_documentation: |-
    Tags show the most distinctive common properties of an object such as a product. Tags don’t move or animate.

    ## Tags on cards

    Up to 4 tags can be used on a product card - but if used should not be clickable, as cards can only contain one link.

    ## Tags on pages

    On a specific page all relevant tags can be shown. Used in this context tags can be tappable or clickable to link to a page displaying other items that share the same property.

    See examples of tags in use on [coop.co.uk/recipes](https://www.coop.co.uk/recipes) and [coop.co.uk/products/wine](https://www.coop.co.uk/products/wine).
  accessibility_documentation: "Interactive tags show an underlined link within a
    lozenge shape. A tag must be large enough for people to activate it easily and

  title: Tables
  status: live
  introduction: Tables are a good way to present large amounts of complex information
    when the user needs to compare different things or or interrogate that information.
    The table format is familiar and, when done well, helps people to find answers
    to questions.
  accessibility_documentation: "### Captions\nA caption is the heading for a table.
    Most screen readers announce the content of captions. Captions help users to find
    a table and understand what it’s about and decide if they want to read it. The
    caption is provided by the &lt;caption&gt; element.\n\n### Headers and footers\nBoth
    columns and rows of a table can have headings. These are marked up as &lt;th&gt;
    (table heading). We also use the &lt;thead&gt;and &lt;tbody&gt; tags. Although
    these are not technically needed in all tables, they add some semantic value and
    are useful if a table needs to be printed as the &lt;thead&gt; element is repeated
    across all printed pages.\n  \nTable footers (&lt;tfoot&gt;) can be used if there
    is a lot of rows in a table. It will be displayed by a browser under the body
    content, but in the markup must be above it. If you have to support a very old
    browser test this display as in some older browsers it is displayed before the
    body. In this case move it to below the table content.\n\n### Row headings\nWhen
    a row needs a heading the &lt;td&gt; of that row should be marked up as a &lt;th&gt;.\n\n###
    Scope\nWhen the data that relates to the headings is ambiguous the attribute scope=&#x201C;col&#x201D;
    or scope=&#x201C;row&#x201D; should be added. The scope attribute defines the
    direction of the header cells and associates them with the corresponding data
    cells. The scope attribute is also needed for larger tables with one header row
    or column. We recommend always defining the scope of your column or row headings.\n
    \ \n### Top left cell\nThe top left cell of a table is often blank as there is
    no overarching header for the row headings and the content of the table has been
    described by the &lt;caption&gt;. This cell can be left blank, but must be marked
    up as an empty &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;.\n"

  introduction: A product card is used to display a snapshot of an item that is linked
    in some way to similar items, for example products we sell or recipes. It lets
    someone quickly identify a particular item of interest to them from a group, for
    example in search results.
  design_and_content_documentation: "A product card links to one item and contains
    a small amount of information, for example an image and important features, sufficient
    to help people make a decision whether to click on the card. \n\nThe whole area
    of a product card is active as a single link. Don’t include other actions within
    a card. \n\nAn important feature of a product card is the image is not obscured
    by any accompanying text, which makes it good for presenting products or anything
    where that is a consideration.\n\nCards are responsive and adapt well to changing
    views, whether displaying few cards or many.\n\nProduct cards are ideal for presenting
    groups of items that share common features or characteristics, for example data
    imported from a spreadsheet. If you are using cards to present more general, prose
    information on different subjects consider using [editorial cards](/pattern-library/components/cards/editorial-card.html)
    instead.\n\nSee examples of the product card component in use on [www.coop.co.uk/products/wine](https://www.coop.co.uk/products/wine)
    and [coop.co.uk/recipes](https://coop.co.uk/recipes).\n\n"
  accessibility_documentation: "Don’t use buttons or links to other destinations within
    a card as this may cause confusion or uncertainty for users.\n\nAll of a card
    should be active so that it creates a large, easily clickable area. \n\nFor more
    information [see our general guide on accessibility.](https://coop-design-system.herokuapp.com//accessibility.html

    with caution.
  design_and_content_documentation: |-
    Use large text areas with caution. Many users find it hard to type, do not like to type or worry about articulating themselves. Large text areas can be daunting and discouraging.

    If you have reason to use them, research them using mobile devices. Entering information using touch devices can be especially time-consuming.

  introduction: |-
    You can use other colours to:

    - draw users’ focus to particular content areas
    - emphasise content so that it’s read in an order that makes sense to users
    - give the impression of depth and layering — this can help structure content in a helpful way for users
  design_and_content_documentation: |+
    These colours have been contrast tested as background colours with white or grey (#282828) text. Use a colour contrast checker when using any other colour of text.

    Use Co-op’s colour palette:

    - to draw users’ focus to particular content areas
    - to give emphasis, depth and highlight to our work where needed
    - in the right context — for example don’t use large amounts of colour in a form, it can distract the user
    - with restraint — users can read content better when we use limited colour
    - to help convey meaning to interaction patterns, for example, for mandatory form fields. Never use colour alone to do this.
    - to communicate the Co-op brand — see the brand guidelines


  accessibility_documentation: |-
    Think about how your colour choices can affect legibility and accessibility — [read WCAG 2.0 specifications on using colour](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0#use-of-color). To be legible, text and background colours must have a minimum contrast between them. You can check colour contrasts online using:

    - [Web Aim's Colour Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
    - [Color Oracle (free colour blindness simulator)](http://colororacle.org/)
    - As well as using these tools, test colour contrast with people of all abilities.

    If you have a question about colour, contact [design@coopdigital.co.uk](mailto:design@coopdigital.co.uk).

  title: Responsive tables
  status: beta
  introduction: |-
    Patterns used for making a table responsive should be appropriate to the data in the table and how users are looking at that data.

    This ‘rows become mini-tables’ approach works for a table with different types of values — including text.
  design_and_content_documentation: |-
    The responsive table takes the same style as the main table — but differ under 480px by the:

    - heading rows becoming table headers
    - table cell borders are removed

    For the styles to work correctly, you must match the markup structure in the example. When deciding whether to use this solution think carefully about if it will fit the needs of your users. If in doubt don't use it, or build your own responsive table. We have made this solution as simple as possible and cannot varify its accessibility yet on smaller device size. Please research your service with users of all abilities.

  introduction: "Quotations highlight and support points within content. \n\nUsually
    quotes come from someone with experience or authority in a subject area. It could
    be an expert or someone who has used a product or service. \n\nIf you’re using
    them on a digital platform you need to make sure that they are going to help the
    user do what they came to do. \n"
  design_and_content_documentation: "Use quotations when you:\n- want to refer to
    what someone said, not to pull out text written within the page copy\n- are referring
    to an external source - remember to cite the author and if possible link to their
    original work\n- are knowingly using a jargon word after giving a plain English
    description, for example, 'the people you want to sort out your will (known as
    'executors')'   \n\nOur quotations use hanging punctuation when using this pattern.
    This means the opening quotation mark must sit in the margin so as not to disrupt
    the flow (left alignment) of the text. If the quote is within the text (on the
    same line) it would not hang.\n\nWhen marking up quotes in HTML - use true quotation
    marks. True quotes are called smart quotes and the right one must be used according
    to whether you are opening (‘) or closing (’) a quotation. [Find out about HTML
    character codes to use for quotes.](https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/punctuation/)\n"
  accessibility_documentation: |-
    Our quotations are marked up with the blockquote element (for the quotation text) and the cite element for referring to the author of the quote.
    According to the W3C, the “blockquote element represents a section that is quoted from another source.” So,  when you use this pattern, do not to use it to refer to text within the same page.
  variations: 'As in the example above - you can use larger text for the quotation
    if the text is shorter.

    ## [We design in context](#context)
    Communicating with a clear voice, at the right time, in the right way.

    We do this by:
    - understanding user needs, the market, technology and our business goals
    - looking at the whole experience for the user, not just the digital part
    - giving information only at the point it’s needed, and through the most effective channel


    ## [We design with purpose](#purpose)
    Making services that are useful, elegant and easy to use.

    We’re doing this by:

    - knowing why the service is needed before we build it
    - measuring and challenging the effectiveness of what we build
    - getting out of the way — helping users achieve their goals as quickly as they can
    - designing services that speak for themselves — they’re self-explanatory and intuitive


    ## [We design for everyone](#everyone)
    Designing so that no one feels different.

    We do this by:

    - communicating in a clear, simple way; opening up our services to everyone
    - designing for people irrespective of their background, circumstance, digital skills or subject knowledge - removing any barriers to our services
    - recognising that people come to our services with their own needs, insecurities and struggles – they deserve our consideration and thoughtfulness


    ## [We design with honesty](#honesty)
    Nothing made up.

    We do this by:

    - being truthful about what we can and cannot do for our users
    - talking about what we’ve done, not what we’ve yet to do
    - being true to our medium, understanding its opportunities and limits


    ## [We design in the open](#open)
    Being co-operative in the way we work with others.

    We do this by:

    - talking about what we’re making as we make it
    - being generous with what we know, and open to learning from others
    - not being afraid to experiment


    ## [We design iteratively](#iteratively)
    There’s no substitute for putting our work in front of real people.

    We do this by:

    - releasing earlier, learning faster
    - learning from what people do, not what they say they do
    - making design decisions based on evidence
    - responding to change

    ## [This is for everyone](#this-is-for-everyone)
    We build our digital services so anyone can use them when they need to. This includes people:

    - with a disability or health condition
    - who use assistive technology
    - with low literacy
    - with English as a second language
    - who are not confident using digital channels

    [We design services for everyone](https://coop-design-system.herokuapp.com/principles.html#everyone).

    ## Accessibility means no barriers
    We believe in removing barriers. No one should be prevented from interacting with us or using our services.

    ## Accessibility means empowerment
    We empower. Accessibility means that people can interact with us independently.

    ## The Equality Act 2010
    We must not distriminate against people who have a disability or health condition. All information and services that are available to people who have not got a disability, must be available to those who have.

    Anticipate the needs of disabled users, as well as reacting to them — monitor and iterate on the accessibility of your service.

    ## [Designing for people with disabilities](#designing-for-people-with-disabilities)
    Every user is different: what may solve an issue for one person may not solve it for another.

    We're not just building websites, we're designing services. We should consider every point in the end-to-end journey that Co-op and our customers interact with each other.

    If a service does not work for someone with an access need, including in any off-line part of the interaction (for example, not offering letters in alternative formats), do what you can to change it. Sometimes, the business will need to change to be truly accessible.

    By regularly carrying out user research with people of various disabilities, you can get evidence to persuade the service that a change is needed.

    ## [Be considerate with language](be-considerate-with-language)
    ### Consider who's reading your content
    Some people can be sensitive to the language we choose to use: what may be right for some people may not be right for others. Research it with real users, write in a sensitive way, and consider that the people reading it may:

    - have accessibility needs
    - have little or no knowledge about the subject you're writing about
    - not be confident using a computer or mobile device
    - have their own situation, insecurities and struggles
    - All users deserve our consideration.

    There's guidance on writing clear, understandable, accessible content in our [content guidelines](https://coop-design-system.herokuapp.com/content.html).

    ## How to talk about disability
    ### Avoid medical terms for people
    You're not a doctor, do not use a doctors terms or medical jargon.

    ### How to write about deafness
    Many deaf people who use British Sign Language as their first language refer to themselves as “Deaf”, with a capital D. That means that they consider themselves part of the Deaf community and have a strong deaf identity.

    When writing about deafness, some people use an upper case D to refer to aspects of deaf culture, and a lower case d when speaking about hearing loss. Which one you use will depend on what you are writing and the research you've done.

    ### Positive language
    Be sensitive about how you refer to people. For example, use ‘partially sighted’ not ‘visually impaired’. Many users with a health condition or disability do not consider themselves to have an impairment.

    Think of mobility aids as just that, rather than someone being “confined to a wheelchair”.

    Avoid phrases such as “suffers from”. They have negative connotations which could be offensive.

    ### Use the language that your users do
    If you’re unsure which terms to use to write about disability, ask people who have a disability.

    Do not let uncertainty draw out your content. Be direct but sensitive.

    ## [Different access needs](different-access-needs)
    ### Eye conditions
    There is a wide spectrum of eye conditions; from colour blindness and low-vision, to partial sightedness and total blindness.

    ### Colour blindness
    There are many types of colour blindness with varying degrees of impact on people’s perception of colour.

    Users with colour blindness may not need to use any special software. But, insufficient colour contrast between text and background, or use of colours alone to denote status or meaning, will make browsing unnecessarily hard.

    Consider including an alternate colour scheme for people who are colour blind (they may use their own browser extension such as [Color Enhancer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-enhancer/ipkjmjaledkapilfdigkgfmpekpfnkih)).

    You can test how accessible colours are to people who are colour blind using the [Color Laboratory app](http://colorlab.wickline.org/colorblind/colorlab/).

    ### Partially sighted
    Partially sighted users will have extreme forms of short or long-sightedness; a small field of vision or their vision may be unclear in other ways.

    Partially sighted people may:

    - use high contrast colour schemes when browsing
    - adjust the size of text
    - magnify the page using assistive technology, such as a screen magnifier or a handheld magnifier
    - use a screen reader or a braille display

    ### Blindness
    Blindness has varying degrees and has different legal measures in different countries.

    People who are “legally blind” may still have the ability to tell light from dark or have residual vision. Blind people often use either a screen reader or a Braille display.

    Your service must work with JavaScript and CSS turned off so that screen readers can work with them.

    ### Hard of hearing and deaf
    Many hard of hearing or deaf people use British Sign Language (BSL) as their first or preferred language, making English their second language. And so some content and concepts may be difficult to understand.

    All content, in any format, should be clear, simple and to the point. Get advice on how to write for Co-op in our [content guidelines](https://coop-design-system.herokuapp.com/content.html).

    Include captions, transcripts, subtitles and BSL interpreted videos where applicable.

    ### Cognitive impairments
    Someone with a cognitive impairment may have trouble with one or two types of mental processing but be fine in other areas.

    There are a huge range of cognitive and learning disabilities with differing needs, but there are some things that can make accessing our services easier for everyone:

    - let users decide how they access the service
    - use plain English and avoid large blocks of text
    - keep lines of text to around 60 characters (90 maximum)
    - break up information with logical sub-headings so people can scan information
    - use large text (minimum 16pt)
    - build in options for customisation (for example, text colour) or alternative output such as Browsealoud
    - avoid italics and complex fonts including those that use serifs
    - avoid anything moving or flickering on the page — if you must, include an easy way to stop it
    - do not use pure white (#fff) page backgrounds

    ### Epilepsy
    Do not use flashing or strobe effects on your pages. This can cause a seizure.

    ## [WAI-ARIA: make your service technically accessible](WAI-ARIA-make-your-service-technically-accessible)
    Websites are getting increasingly complex. They can become inaccessible when assistive technologies do not understand the meaning behind the code — it can make it hard, impossible even, for the user to navigate properly with a screenreader.

    WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a technical specification that tells you how you can increase the accessibility of your web page. It allows you to associate elements with an WAI-ARIA (or ARIA for short) role and allows you to attach states and properties to support these roles.

    HTML5 elements already contain ARIA behaviour, for example nav doesn't need aria-role=’navigation’ unless supporting an older browser.

    See the full list of ARIA roles available from W3.

    There are some common patterns we're using at Co-op:

    ### Content-info
    This is used to to declare a region of the page that contains information about the parent document. For example, 'privacy policy' and 'terms and conditions' links. This role is usually placed on the footer element.

    <pre class=" language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>footer</span> <span class="token attr-name">role</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>contentinfo<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
        <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>ul</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
            <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>li</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>”#”</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>Privacy Policy<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
            <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>li</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>”#”</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>Terms &amp; Conditions<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
        <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>ul</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>footer</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>

    ### Alerts
    This role is used to convey an important message to the user. An alert event will be sent to various assistive technologies to allow them to alert the user quickly.

    <pre class=" language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">role</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>alert<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>You need to perform an action to fix something<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>

    ### Presentation/no context
    This role is used when there is no context to an element and the screen reader (or other assistive technology) does not need to ‘talk’ about it. For example, a decorative image.

    <pre class=" language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>img</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>decorative-image.jpg<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">alt</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">aria-role</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>presentation<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">/&gt;</span></span></code></pre>

    ### Visibility
    Use 'aria-hidden' to hide content from screen readers. Most screen readers will ignore display:none so use this to hide subfields until a user action. If you do not use this, some screenreaders may still read out these hidden fields which could be confusing to the user.

    <pre class=" language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span> <span class="token attr-name">aria-hidden</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>true<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>This content is hidden.<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span> <span class="token attr-name">aria-hidden</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>false<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>This content is not hidden.<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>This content is also not hidden.<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>

    ### Importance of new content
    An ARIA live region is a way of notifying screen readers when content is updated on the page. Screenreader support tends to be inconsisent but it's getting better. It does work on VoiceOver on macOS and iOS.

    A screen reader can only focus on one part of the page at a time. If a new bit of content is updated, such as a validation error outside of the current zone the screenreader is in, the user might miss this update.

    ARIA live regions tackle this by utilising 3 states, these are: off, polite and assertive.

    <pre class=" language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span> <span class="token attr-name">aria-live</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>off<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>aria-live is off, there will be no notification<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span> <span class="token attr-name">aria-live</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>polite<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>The screen reader will notify the user of a change when the current task is complete<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span> <span class="token attr-name">aria-live</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>assertive<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>The screen reader will interupt the current task to notifiy the user of a change<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>

    Only use assertive when absolutely nessesary (for example, form validation which needs the user to act) as it can be disruptive.

    ## [Key common issues](key-common-issues)
    There are some common accessibility issue that crop up across the web. Many can be easily fixed:

    ### Semantic code
    Text must have a minimum contrast ratio of 1:4.3 at 24px bold and 19px regular. You can test this using [WebAims Contrast Checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

    You could also use a 'dropper' style tool like this c[olour contrast analyser from the Paciello Group](https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/) which allows you to select a colour.

    For some users low contrast is preferable (for example, for some people with dyslexia). To accommodate different contrast needs, consider:

    - letting users add their own style sheets
    - letting users customise the web page using in-page controls
    - making other aspects of the page more accessible - using larger fonts and non-white backgrounds can make high contrast text easier to read

    [How we use color](https://coop-design-system.herokuapp.com/pattern-library/foundations/colour.html).

    ### Links
    There is no need to provide description alt/title text on links. Simply create descriptive link text instead. If the link is to a file, include what format the file is in, for example: Annual Report [PDF].

    Never use the text "click here". Not only is this link text not descriptive of the destination, it implies the user needs to click rather than use their keyboard.

    Every link must give a clear indication of what it does. Screenreader users or magnification users will find it easier to navigate.

    Users can use screen reader functionality to list just the links on a page. And many screen reader users audio skim — they just listen to the start of the link. So, link text like this would be problematic:

    - Change your address
    - Change your name
    - Change your answers for question 1
    - Screen reader users might just hear ‘change, change, change’. This is distracting, and potentially annoying.

    Front-load links so the important information is at the beginning of the link.

    Find out more about [how we use links](https://coop-design-system.herokuapp.com/pattern-library/foundations/links.html) and [writing accessible links](https://coop-design-system.herokuapp.com/content.html#links).

    ### Images
    If an image has no context (therefore doesn’t need to be seen by a screen reader) you can set an empty alt attribute and set the role attribute to 'presentation'.

    The role attribute ensures that the screen reader does not read out the filename of the image instead.

    This webaim article on alternative text can help you decide if your images should include alt text.

    ### Tab index
    There’s no need to use this. If your code is semantic it will tab just fine.

    If you need to alert your user to something urgently — for example to display an error message — use negative integers as your value.

    ### Heading and titles
    Use appropriate heading levels. It's a common misconception from the XHTML/HTML4 days that you can only have one h2 per page. You can have more than one h2 in HTML5 as long as they belong inside a article or section. If you're writing XHTML/HTML4, follow the correct semantics.

    Find out more about headings in HTML5 on the Evanto website.

    [How to write titles](https://coop-design-system.herokuapp.com/content.html#titles).

    ### Labels
    Always provide hidden labels for visual formats that you might consider obvious (like asking for someone's date of birth) — the format may only be obvious for sighted people.

    ### Form elements
    The (appropriate) form control must have matching for and id attributes. The id attribute must be unique to the page as per semantics.

    A fieldset should be used around logical groupings of form controls, such as a group of radio buttons or checkboxes. These fieldsets must use a legend within them to provide context.

    <option> groups can have a value="" inside them to utilise order. Use <optgroup> wherever possible in your option lists to give more context.

    For example:

    <pre class=" language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>select</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
        <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>optgroup</span> <span class="token attr-name">label</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>Favourite fruit<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
            <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>option</span> <span class="token attr-name">value</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>banana<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>Banana<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>option</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
            <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>option</span> <span class="token attr-name">value</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>watermelon<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>Watermelon<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>option</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
        <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>optgroup</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
        <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>optgroup</span> <span class="token attr-name">label</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>Favourite Bread<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

        <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>optgroup</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>select</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>

    Use 'aria-required'. A screen reader may not pick up the "required asterix" or may not understand what that concept means.

    There are many useful ARIA attributes you can use in your forms to enhance the experience for people using a screenreader. A good introduction to ARIA roles in forms is available on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/forms/Basic_form_hints).

    [How to design forms](https://coop-design-system.herokuapp.com/styles/forms/index.html).

    ### Readability (characters per line)
    As close to 66 characters per line as possible is ideal. As long as the range is between 45 and 75 characters, your content will be easier to read by everyone, regardless of any access need.

    If a line of text is too wide, the user's eyes will struggle to focus on the text because it’s hard to see where the line starts and ends. It can also be hard to continue to the next line in the correct place.

    If the line of text is too narrow, the eye will have to travel back and forth too often. This is tiring and could be stressful for users, especially if they have dyslexia.

    ## [How to learn](how-to-learn)
    If we all work together, learn and continue to care about accessibility we'll create Co-op digitals products and services that are truly accessible to all.

    There are a number of ways we can [design in the open](https://coop-design-system.herokuapp.com/principles.html#open):

    ### Mentor other colleagues
    If you've learnt something that could be relevant to other services, share it with your colleagues.

    ### Sit with other teams
    We have lots of teams working on different things with different challenges, spend time learning what other teams are up to.

    ### Document common issues
    Another team could be having the same or similar issues as you. Share your problems, along with any solutions you've tried. Another team may well have a solution to something you're trying to tackle.

    ### Test with users with access needs
    This is by far the most important thing you can do. Research your products and services with a variety of people with a range of access needs.

  introduction: |-
    We write content for the user, not for us.

    So, we design content to give users what they need:

    - only when they need it
    - as simply and quickly as possible
    - using words they understand
    - in a consistent way

    We design in context.

    Designing content that puts our users first makes it easier and faster for them to use our services, encourages them to interact with us again and builds trust in what we’re saying.

    [Brackets ('parentheses')](#brackets) \n### Round brackets\nUse round brackets
    to:\n\n- clarify an acronym or technical term that you’ll use from that point
    onwards, for example: ‘Customer team member (CTM)’, or ‘the people you want to
    sort out your will (known as 'executors')'\n- include supplementary information
    that’s not essential to the main point of your sentence – information that, if
    removed, would not change the meaning of the sentence\n\nDo not use round brackets
    to indicate that something can be singular or plural, like:\n\n‘Check which document(s)
    you need to send to HR’\n\nInstead, use the plural, as this will cover each possibility:
    ‘Check which documents you need to send to HR .’\n\n(A complete sentence that
    stands alone in parentheses starts with a capital letter and ends with a full
    stop before the closing bracket.)'\n\nTry not to overuse brackets, they can disrupt
    the flow of reading.\n\n### Square brackets\nOnly use square brackets to when
    you need to add clarification to a quote or something you've not written yourself,
    like:\n\n\"It [content] deserves our full time and attention\".\n\n## [Using Co-op](#using-co-op)
    \nRefer to Co‑op as a noun in writing as ‘Co‑op’, and not (where possible/practical)
    as ‘the Co‑op’.\n\nWe know that users tend to refer to our food stores as ‘the
    Co‑op’, so dropping the ‘the’ avoids any confusion.\n\nMake sure you use a non-breaking
    hyphen using &#8209;. This will ensure the word ‘Co‑op’ does not break when it
    appears at the end of a line.\n\nRefer to our business units as Co‑op Funeralcare,
    Co‑op Digital etc. (Two words, both capitalised.)\n\nWhen we're talking about
    our organisation in terms of what we do, it's fine to use Co‑op as an adjective,
    as in 'Co‑op values'.\n\nNo need to capitalise 'Co‑operative' when it appears
    as an adjective or a noun unless you are referring to the Co‑operative Group.\n\nHowever,
    do not talk about 'the Group' to an external audience. It doesn't mean anything
    to anyone outside Co‑op.\n\nUsing 'our' as in 'our Co‑op' can be powerful but
    use with caution - is it clear who 'our' is? Will 'our' mean the same thing to
    your reader as it does to you? It’s more suited to an internal audience.\n\n'Co‑operative'
    and ‘Co‑op’ are always hyphenated.\n\nThe only exception to this rule is on social
    media when using a hashtag such as #TheCoopWay or #BeingCoop.\n\n## [Dates and
    times](#dates-and-times)\nThe following guidance on dates and times is taken from
    gov.uk:\n\n### Dates\nAs a general rule, dates should be capitalised and written
    out in full like this:\n\n‘1 January 2018’\n\nBut if you’re limited with space,
    such as creating a table, then ‘Jan’, ‘Feb’ and so on is fine.\n\nDon't use ordinal
    numbers for dates like 10th, 1st and so on. It's easy to get wrong and uses more
    characters.\n\nIf you’re referring to date ranges, then use ‘to’ rather than hyphens,
    en rules or em dashes.\n\nIt should look like this: January to March\n\nAvoid
    all references to annual quarters. Instead, write the dates in full:\n\n‘This
    offer is valid between 1 October 2018 and 31 December 2018.’\n\n### Times\nUse
    the 12 hour clock. It’s easier to understand and helps avoids confusion:\n\n‘Monday
    to Friday, 9am to 5pm.’\n\nIf you need to include minutes, write it like this:\n\n‘9.15am’\n\nUse
    ‘midday’ rather than noon, 12noon, or 12pm.\n\nFor example: ‘This store closes
    24 December, midday.’\n\nUse ‘midnight’ rather 12am, but be careful that it’s
    not misleading. For example, if I said:\n\n‘Please complete and send your application
    form by 6 July 2018, at midnight’\n\nThen you might wonder if I meant ‘ 6 July
    2018, 11.59pm’ or ‘5 July 2018, 11.59pm’\n\nTo avoid this confusion, consider
    using ‘11.59pm’ where possible.\n\nIt’s not necessary to specify time zones, such
    as ‘1pm GMT’.\n\n## [Colons and semicolons](#colons-and-semicolons)\nUse a colon
    at the end of a lead-in line to a bulleted list, for example:\n\nYou need to bring:\n\n-
    your driving licence or passport\n- a copy of your P60\n- something else\n\nIf
    you use a colon to continue or explain an idea that you mention before the colon,
    consider whether it would be better to have 2 sentences or an em dash.\n\nAvoid
    using semicolons — they can make sentences long and hard-to-read. If you think
    a sentence needs a semicolon, break it into separate sentences.\n\n## [Ellipsis](#ellipsis)\n\nEllipsis
    are 3 dots that should only be used when:\n\n- you’re quoting someone and need
    to show words have been missed out — only do this is the meaning will not be changed,
    for example: “We're building things that are user-centric… doing the hard work
    centrally to make things clearer, simpler and quicker.\"\n- to indicate there's
    more to come, for example, in a header: 'We asked our users to name a wine…’\n\nIf
    you use ellipsis, use 3 dots only. They should follow straight on after the previous
    word (with no space), and have one space after.\n\nIf the ellipsis ends the sentence,
    do not add an additional full stop.\n\nIf you’re putting an ellipsis in html use
    &hellip;.\n\n\n## [Frequently asked questions (FAQs)](#faqs)\n\nDo not use FAQs.\n\nInstead,
    if you know that you are answering a genuine frequently asked question, restructure
    your content so that the answers form part of the main user journey. And put the
    information in a logical place in that journey.\n\nWe do not use FAQs because:\n\n-
    users do not know if their question has been frequently asked\n- they're often
    made up by the business rather than genuinely asked by the public\n- users have
    to navigate through irrelevant content to see if their question is there — it’s
    frustrating and wastes their time\n- we should be creating services that speak
    for themselves: [we design with purpose](https://coop-design-manual.herokuapp.com/principles.html#purpose)\n\nFor
    more information read [Content Strategist Sarah Richards' blog on FAQs](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/07/25/faqs-why-we-dont-have-them/).\n\n##
    [Hyphens and dashes](hyphens-and-dashes)\n\nWhat you’re writing will determine
    where and when you should use hyphens and dashes.\n\nHyphens (the character you
    get when you type ‘-’ ) should be used to link words or part of words — they show
    the user that there’s a connection between them, for example, ‘mother-in-law’,
    ‘fine-tuned’, ‘Co‑op’.\n\nEn dashes (&ndash;) should be used for connecting things
    that are related to each other by distance such as June–July.\n\nEm dashes (&mdash;)
    can be used in pairs like parenthesis — that is, to enclose a word, or a phrase
    — or they can be used alone to detach one end of a sentence from the main body.\n\n##
    [Job titles](job-titles)\nShould only be capitalised when associated with a name
    - otherwise lower case.\n\nFor example: Chief Executive Mary Smith, a boatload
    of chief executives.\n\n## [Links](links)\n\nA link should be descriptive of the
    place it's taking the user. Do not use text such as ‘click here’, or anything
    that does not make sense when read out of context — screen readers can read link
    text in isolation without the surrounding content.\n\nLink text must:\n\n- tell
    the user where it’s taking them\n- be action orientated, for example, ‘Choose…’,
    ‘Find…’, ‘Discover…’\n- not include a title tag — this accessibility feature is
    not used any more as it’s not that helpful for visually impaired people\n- tell
    the user if they’re leaving our site, for example, ‘For more information visit
    [www.citizensadvice.org.uk](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk)’\n- use a full
    url if it’s clean (no symbols), short and potentially easy to remember (max one
    / ) for example: [bbc.co.uk/sport](https://bbc.co.uk/sport) — otherwise, if there’s
    a complex url, use a ‘word’ link\n\nWhen you are linking to another page or an
    external site, think about your user‘s onward journey. If the page you’re linking
    to opens in:\n\n- the same window, your user may lose their place in the information
    flow\n- a different window, your user may find it difficult to navigate back to
    your site\n- Use this to consider how and where to position your links.\n\n##
    [Lists](lists)\n### Bullet lists\n\nBullets must:\n\n- use a lead-in line\n- make
    sense running on from the lead-in line\n- use lower case at the start of the bullet\n-
    have only one sentence per bullet point — use commas, dashes or semicolons to
    expand on an item\n\nBullets should not:\n\n- be paragraphs masquerading as a
    list for a visual effect\n- use a full stop after the last bullet point\n- include
    ‘or’ or an ‘and’ after the bullets\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"column
    medium-7 small-12\">\n    <h3 class=\"example-heading\"><span class=\"example_label\">Example</span></h3>\n
    \   <div class=\"example example--padded\">\n      <h4>The meeting agenda will
    be:</h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li>an overview of the last month</li>\n        <li>a
    presentation</li>\n        <li>a special announcement</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n
    \ </div>\n</div>\n\n\n### Numbered lists\n\nUse a numbered list for a logical
    sequence of things, like a series of tasks that must be done in a certain order.
    They do not need a lead-in line and should be complete sentences that start with
    a capital letter and end with a full stop.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"column
    medium-7 small-12\">\n    <h3 class=\"example-heading\"><span class=\"example_label\">Example</span></h3>\n
    \   <div class=\"example example--padded\">\n      <h4>How to put your shoes on:</h4>\n
    \     <ol>\n        <li>Put on socks.</li>\n        <li>Put on shoes.</li>\n        <li>Tie
    laces.</li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n## [Money](money)\n\nUse
    the £ symbol: £75\n\nCurrencies are lower case.\n\nWrite out pence in full: calls
    will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline.\n\nDon’t use decimals unless pence
    are included: £75.50 but not £75.00\n\nCheck the advice about numbers and units
    for amounts over 1,000.\n\n## [Numbers and units](numbers-and-units)\n\nUse ‘one’
    unless you’re talking about a step, a point in a list or another situation where
    using the numeral makes more sense.\n\nWrite all numbers in numerals (including
    2 to 9) except where it’s part of a common expression and it would look strange,
    like ‘one or two of them’.\n\nIf a number starts a sentence, write it out in full
    (‘Thirty-four hula-hoops found in researcher’s filing cupboard’) except where
    it starts a title or subheading.\n\nFor numerals over 999, insert a comma for
    clarity. For example, ‘It was over 1,000’.\n\nSpell out common fractions, such
    as one-half.\n\nUse a % sign for percentages: 50%, not ‘pc’ or ‘percent’.\n\nUse
    a 0 where there’s no digit before the decimal point.\n\nIn tables, use numerals
    throughout (not written numbers).\n\nFor big numbers use ‘million’, ‘billion’
    and so on, written without a space after the number — for example, £3.5million.\n\n###
    Ordinal numbers: first, second and so on\n\nSpell out 'first' to 'ninth'. After
    that use 10th, 11th and so on.\n\nBut, write dates as 10 January 2017.\n\n###
    Units\n\nUse MB not KB for anything over 1MB, for example 4.09MB not 4096KB.\n\nFor
    anything under 1MB, use KB, for example, 569KB not 0.55MB.\n\nKeep units as accurate
    as possible and up to 2 decimal places. For example, 4.03MB.\n\n## [Dates and
    times](dates-and-times)\nThe following guidance on dates and times is taken from
    gov.uk:\n\n### Dates\n\nAs a general rule, dates should be capitalised and written
    out in full like this:\n\n‘1 January 2018’\n\nBut if you’re limited with space,
    such as creating a table, then ‘Jan’, ‘Feb’ and so on is fine.\n\nDon't use ordinal
    numbers for dates like 10th, 1st and so on. It's easy to get wrong and uses more
    characters.\n\nIf you’re referring to date ranges, then use ‘to’ rather than hyphens,
    en rules or em dashes.\n\nIt should look like this: January to March\n\nAvoid
    all references to annual quarters. Instead, write the dates in full:\n\n‘This
    offer is valid between 1 October 2018 and 31 December 2018.’\n\n### Times\n\nUse
    the 12 hour clock. It’s easier to understand and helps avoids confusion:\n\n‘Monday
    to Friday, 9am to 5pm.’\n\nIf you need to include minutes, write it like this:\n\n‘9.15am’\n\nUse
    ‘midday’ rather than noon, 12noon, or 12pm.\n\nFor example: ‘This store closes
    24 December, midday.’\n\nUse ‘midnight’ rather than 12am, but be careful that
    it’s not misleading. For example, if I said:\n\n‘Please complete and send your
    application form by 6 July 2018, at midnight’\n\nThen you might wonder if I meant
    ‘ 6 July 2018, 11.59pm’ or ‘5 July 2018, 11.59pm’\n\nTo avoid this confusion,
    consider using ‘11.59pm’ where possible.\n\nIt’s not necessary to specify time
    zones, such as ‘1pm GMT’.\n\n## [Phone numbers](phone-numbers)\n\nShow a mobile
    phone number like this: 08765 555 333.\n\nShow a UK landline number like this:
    0161 000 0000 or 01524 000 000.\n\nShow an overseas number as you'd dial it from
    the UK, so no + or (0): 00 353 1 222 3333.\n\nRemember:\n- include call charges\n-
    include opening hours\n- make sure phone numbers are usable from mobiles\n\n##
    [Titles](titles)\n\nTitles should:\n- be sentence case\n- be less than 65 characters
    within HTML document titles — Google cuts them off after this\n- be unique, clear
    and descriptive — no puns or single topic words\n- be front-loaded with key words
    if possible — people tend to scan the first couple of words only\n- use words
    you know your users actually search for\n- be active where possible, ‘Apply for…’,
    ‘Report…’, ‘Find…’\n- not use acronyms unless they are well-known, like EU, BBC.\n\n##
    [Validation messages](validation-messages)\n\nValidation messages must:\n\n- be
    flagged at the top of the screen and at each relevant field\n- be a bulleted list
    if there’s more than one error\n- be a complete sentence if there’s only one error
    (no bullet)\n- be linked from the top of the page to take users to the relevant
    field\n- help the user fix the problem, for example, ‘Check you've entered the
    correct sort code — it’s the 6 digit number usually found on your bank card’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

  introduction: |
    We write content for the user, not for ourselves.

    So, we design content to give users what they need:
    - only when they need it
    - as simply and quickly as possible
    - using words they understand
    - in a consistent way

    Designing content that puts our users first makes it easier and faster for them to use our services, encourages them to interact with us again and builds trust in what we’re saying.

  content: "## [A](#a)\n\n### 1 Angel Square\nThe name of Co-op’s building in Manchester.
    \nThe name and address is 1 Angel Square. \nDo not refer to it as ‘head office’,
    ‘headquarters’ or ‘1AS’.\n \n### Abbreviations and acronyms\nSpell out abbreviations
    and acronyms the first time you use them, followed by the abbreviation in brackets.
    Do not use full stops within or after abbreviations or acronyms.\n \nFor example
    write ‘Customer Relationship Management (CRM)’ and then ‘CRM’ each time after
    that.\n \nMake exceptions for familiar acronyms like URL, BBC or HR. You do not
    need to spell them out in the first instance.\n \n### Alcohol\nDo not promote
    alcohol in a way that makes it seem as though it:\n \n- appeals to under 18s\n-
    incorporates people who look under 25\n- suggests alcohol is life enhancing or
    therapeutic\n- is easy to down or binge drink\n- leads to social success\n- suggests
    an association with bravado or antisocial behaviour\n- benefits from higher alcohol
    content\n- has any association with sexual activity or sexual success\n- has acceptance
    of, or an illusion to, illicit drugs\n \nFor example, do not say ‘you’ll be cooler
    with a glass of wine, feel better with a lovely beer’.\n \nSee the Portman code
    for full guidance.\n[portmangroup.org.uk/codes/alcohol-marketing/code-of-practice](http://portmangroup.org.uk/codes/alcohol-marketing/code-of-practice
    \"portmangroup.org.uk/codes/alcohol-marketing/code-of-practice\") \n \nAlways
    communicate the alcoholic nature of a drink and include the Drinkaware logo on
    any alcohol product advertising. Even on drinks that look like alcohol where there
    is no context that the drink is nonalcoholic, for example mocktails.\n \nThe laws
    around the promotion of alcohol differ in countries across the UK, and even in
    some local authorities.\n \nIn Scotland, promotions are only acceptable when displayed
    in designated zones. \n\nAny communication that includes alcohol must be approved
    by the Co-op legal team.\n\n### Areas\n\nCymru/Wales\n \nCentral and Eastern\n
    \nEast Midlands\n \nEast of England\n \nIsle of Man\n \nLondon\n \nNorth East\n
    \nNorth West\n \nNorthern Ireland\n \nScotland\n \nSouth East\n \nSouth West\n
    \nWest Midlands\n \nYorkshire and the Humber\n\n\n## [B](#b)\n\n### board members\n
    \n### the Co-op board\nYou can find out more about the Co-op board and directors
    on our website.\n\n### Brackets or parentheses\n#### Round brackets\nUse round
    brackets to clarify an acronym or technical term that you’ll use from that point
    onwards, for example: ‘customer team member (CTM)’, or ‘the people you want to
    sort out your will (known as ‘executors’)’. \n\nThey can also include supplementary
    information that’s not essential to the main point of your sentence. Information
    that, if removed, would not change the meaning of the sentence.\n\nDo not use
    round brackets to indicate that something can be singular or plural, like: ‘Check
    which document(s) you need to send to HR’.\n\nInstead, use the plural, as this
    will cover each possibility: ‘Check which documents you need to send to HR’.\n\n(A
    complete sentence that stands alone in parentheses starts with a capital letter
    and ends with a full stop before the closing bracket.)\n\nTry not to overuse brackets,
    as they can disrupt the flow of reading.\n\n#### Square brackets\nOnly use square
    brackets when you need to add clarification to a quote or something you’ve not
    written yourself, like: ‘It [content] deserves our full time and attention’.\n\n\n##
    [C](#c)\n \n### cafe\n\n### colons and semicolons\nUse a colon at the end of a
    lead-in line to a bulleted list. For example:\n\nYou need to bring:\n- your driving
    licence or passport\n- a copy of your P60\n- proof of your address, like a recent
    utility bill\n\n\nIf you’re using a colon or semicolon, it can make your sentence
    long and hard to read. If you think a sentence needs one of these, break it into
    separate sentences instead. \n\n### Co-op\nRefer to Co-op in writing as ‘Co-op’,
    upper case and hyphenated. Do not use ‘Co-op Group’ or ‘the Group’.\n\nWhere possible
    and practical, try not to say ‘the Co‑op’. We know that users tend to refer to
    our food stores as ‘the Co‑op’, so dropping the ‘the’ avoids any confusion.\n\nOur
    businesses are capitalised, so Co-op Food, Co-op Funeralcare for example. You
    can refer to them without ‘Co-op’ so ‘our Food business’ or ‘visit one of our
    Food stores’.\n\nUsing ‘our’ as in ‘our Co‑op’ can be powerful but use it with
    caution. Is it clear who ‘our’ is? Will ‘our’ mean the same thing to your reader
    as it does to you? It’s more suited to an internal audience.\n\n### Co-operative\nOnly
    use ‘co-operative’ when talking about things like ‘the co-operative movement’
    or ‘other co-operative societies’ and it should be lower case, unless it’s at
    the start of a sentence.\n\n‘Co‑operative’ and ‘Co‑op’ are always hyphenated.
    The only exception to this rule is on social media when using a hashtag such as
    #TheCoopWay or #BeingCoop, or in a website address like coop.co.uk.\n \n### Co-operative
    Banking Group\nNo longer part of Co-op.\n \n### Co-op branded\nNot ‘own-brand’.\n\n###
    Co-op Commitment\n\n### Co-op committees \nThere are various committees made up
    of members of the board. You can find out more about the committees on our website.
    \n \nrisk and audit committee\nnominations committee\nremuneration committee\nscrutiny
    committee\nnon-executive directors’ fees committee\n\n### Co-operative Group Limited\nThe
    trading name of Co-op, use it only when you need to for legal reasons.\n \n###
    co-operative movement\n \n### co-operative principles\n \n### co-operative societies\n
    \n### other co-operatives\nnot ‘other co-ops’\n \n### Co-op National Members’
    Council\nUse the full title where possible, but you can also refer to this as
    ‘our Members’ Council’.\nYou can find out more about the Co-op National Members’
    Council on our website.\n \n### Co-op Members’ Council terms\nAnnual General Meeting
    (AGM)\nthe council senate\nthe council president\nmember nominated directors\nmembers’
    motion (a proposal that is voted on by members at our AGM. Motions can be put
    forward by our business, our members’ council or by individual members and some
    motions are required by our Rules.)\nelections\nstand for election\n\n### Co-op
    Young Members’ Group (CYMG)\nA group of 6 young members who work with Co-op on
    specific projects to ensure that an authentic voice for young people is heard.
    Use full title in the first instance. Can be shortened to ‘our Young Members’
    Group’ or CYMG after that.\n\n### Contractions\nUse contractions like 'it's' and
    'there's' to make your writing more informal and friendly - the way people tend
    to speak.\n\nBut do not use negative contractions like 'don't' and 'won't', instead
    use 'do not' and 'will not'. Research has shown that some users need the 'not'
    to understand what's being said. You can find out more about problems with negative
    contractions in Content Designer Jo Schofield’s blog post on Medium.\n\nDo not
    force contractions if they look and feel odd. For example ‘they’ll’ and ‘there’ll’
    are likely to slow people down.\n\n\n## [D](#d)\n \n### Date\nMonday 21 June 2018.\nUse
    only as much description as needed - you do not need to include the year every
    time if it’s obvious from context.\n\nIf you’re referring to date ranges, then
    use ‘to’ rather than hyphens or dashes. It should look like this: January to March\n\nAvoid
    all references to annual quarters. Instead, write the dates in full: ‘This offer
    is valid between 1 October and 31 December 2018.’\n \n### Decades\nUse numerals
    and write out decades in full, so 1970s not ‘70s.\n \n### dividend\n \n### Direct
    Debit\n \n\n## [E](#e)\n \n### Eg\nDo not use. Not everyone understands what it
    means. Say ‘for example’ instead.\n\nFor more information read this blog post
    about the use of contractions like ‘eg’ on GOV.UK.\n\n### Ellipsis (&hellip;)\nEllipsis
    are 3 dots that should only be used:\n- when you’re quoting someone and need to
    show words have been missed out — only do this if it will not change the meaning,
    for example: “We’re building things that are user-centric&hellip; doing the hard
    work centrally to make things clearer, simpler and quicker.”\n- to indicate there’s
    more to come, for example, in a header: ‘We asked our users to name a wine…’\n\n\nIf
    you use an ellipsis, use 3 dots only. They should follow straight on after the
    previous word (with no space), and have one space after.\n\nIf the ellipsis ends
    the sentence, do not add an additional full stop.\n\nIf you’re putting an ellipsis
    in html use the code &hellip so the dots do not break. (like this &hellip;)\n\n###
    Email\n\n### Etc\nDo not use. Not everyone understands what it means. If you need
    to make it clear there are more unspecified items at the end of a list, you can
    use “and so on”.\n\n### Exclamation marks\nTry not to use them unless they’re
    essential - they can look flippant and make your content lose impact when they’re
    over-used. \n\nBy simply ending your sentence with a full stop instead, you’re
    allowing your reader to focus on the message, rather than wonder whether your
    tone is insincere or strident.\n \n\n## [F](#f)\n \n### Fairer Finance\n \n###
    Fairtrade\nUsed for products or the Fairtrade initiative. For example: ‘We’re
    proud to support Fairtrade’ or ‘All our bagged sugar is Fairtrade’.\n \n### fair
    trade\nThe theory and practice of fair trade, where producers in developing countries
    are paid a fair price for the goods they supply to companies in developed countries.\n
    \n### Fair Trade\nUsed for Co-op products that are certified by a credible fair
    trade organisation such as Traidcraft, but where there is no FAIRTRADE Mark available.
    Currently this applies to charcoal and rubber gloves.\n\n### FAIRTRADE Mark\nThe
    formal certification on products which contain ingredients certified by the Fairtrade
    Labelling Organisation (FLO).\n\n### Fairtrade Fortnight\nAn annual celebration
    of Fairtrade used as a focus point for campaigners, businesses and the Fairtrade
    Foundation to educate the wider public on the benefits of Fairtrade. For example
    “Join us in celebrating Fairtrade Fortnight”.\n\n### FAQs\nDo not use FAQs.\n\nInstead,
    if you know that you are answering a genuine frequently asked question, restructure
    your content so that the answers form part of the main user journey. And put the
    information in a logical place in that journey.\n\nWe do not use FAQs because:\n-
    users do not know if their question has been frequently asked\n- they’re often
    made up by the business rather than genuinely asked by the public\n- users have
    to navigate through irrelevant content to see if their question is there, which
    is frustrating and wastes their time\n- we should be creating services that speak
    for themselves: we design with purpose\n\nFor more information read Content Strategist

    made Memorial Masonry Plan\n\n\n## [G](#g)\n \n### Group Chief Executive\n \n##
    [H](#h)\n \n### Halloween\n\n### high street\n \n### Hyphens\nHyphens (the character
    you get when you type ‘-’ ) are used to link words or part of words. They show
    the user that there’s a connection between them, for example, ‘mother-in-law’,
    ‘fine-tuned’, ‘Co-op’.\n\nOnly use a hyphen when it’s needed for clarity or is
    crucial to your meaning. Too many hyphens can be distracting and confusing, especially
    when used incorrectly. The exception is Co-op or co-operative, which are always
    hyphenated.\n\n\n## [I](#i)\n \n### I.e.\nDo not use. Not everyone understands
    what it means, say ‘in other words’. For more information read this blog about
    contractions like this on GOV.UK.\n\n### Insurance terms\n#### no claim discount
    \nAlways sentence case but you can say NCD after this, for example ‘Your no claim
    discount (NCD) is…’\n\n#### written-off \nUse write off in the future tense, for
    example ‘We will write off your car if it's too broken’ but ‘If your car's written-off
    by the garage…’\n\n#### HomeRescue Plus\nA home insurance optional extra product
    which provides help in an emergency, such as a boiler breakdown or if you’ve lost
    your keys. If you’re talking about generic home emergency cover, say ‘home assistance’.\n\n####
    life cover\nSometimes called life insurance.\n\n#### The Royal London Group\nFor
    example, life cover is offered through Co-op Insurance Services and is provided,
    underwritten and administered by The Royal London Group.\n\n#### single-trip\nA
    type of insurance cover for a specific trip, for example ‘single-trip insurance’.\n\n####
    multi-trip\nTravel insurance that covers you for more than one trip, for example
    ‘multi-trip insurance’.\n\n#### MAPFRE Asistencia\nFor example, ‘travel insurance
    is offered through Co-op Insurance Services and underwritten by MAPFRE Asistencia’.\n\n####
    multi-pet\nInsurance that covers more than one pet.\n\n#### Allianz Insurance
    plc \nFor example pet insurance is offered through Co‑op Insurance Services and
    underwritten by Allianz Insurance plc.\n\n#### black box\nnot smartbox.\n\n####

    \n### intranet\n \n### independent co-operatives\n \n\n## [J](#j)\n \n### Job
    titles\nCapitalised when talking about a specific person’s job role. For example,
    Mary Smith, Content Designer. \n\nLower case when talking about a generic job
    role. For example, a team leader or executive.\n\nFuneral Director is the exception
    and is always capitalised. \n \n### Jargon\nUse plain English and avoid jargon
    (specialist language) where possible. Your writing is easier to understand when
    you use the words your audience uses.\n \nTry not to use:\n- Puns. If the reader
    doesn’t recognise something is meant to be a pun it can be confusing\n- Slang.
    It’s hard to understand, slang terms can be used differently across cultures and
    regions, and all slang can quickly fall out of use\n\nOnly use jargon or specialist
    terms if the reader might see or hear the term elsewhere, for example if it’s
    widely used in a store or over the phone. Always give a definition when you first
    use them. For example: ‘partners can choose to make near identical wills that
    leave their estate to the other person (known as ‘mirror wills’)’.\n\n### Join
    In \nJoin In is an opportunity for members to get involved with their Co-op and
    influence decision-making. \n\nUse lower case when talking about members ‘joining
    in’.\n\n\n## [L](#l)\n \n### Later life planning terms\nGeneric words like ‘my
    plan’, ‘set plan’ or ‘tailor made plan’ should be lower case, unless they begin
    the sentence or are used as a title.\n \nPlan names should be capitalised as they
    are names of products, so ‘Simple Funeral Plan’ or ‘Gold Funeral Plan’.\n\n###
    Links\nA link should be descriptive of the place it’s taking the user. Do not
    use text such as ‘click here’, or anything that does not make sense when read
    out of context — screen readers can read link text in isolation without the surrounding
    content.\n\nLink text must:\n- tell the user where it’s taking them\n- be action
    orientated, for example, ‘Choose an option’, ‘Find more information about the
    discount’, ‘Discover…’\n- tell the user if they’re leaving our site, for example,
    ‘For more information visit citizensadvice.org.uk’\n- use a full url if it’s clean
    (no symbols), short and potentially easy to remember (max one / ) for example:
    bbc.co.uk/sport,otherwise, if there’s a complex url, use a ‘word’ link\n- not
    include a title tag, this accessibility feature is not used any more as it’s not
    that helpful for visually impaired people\n\n\nWhen you are linking to another
    page or an external site, think about your user‘s onward journey. If the page
    you’re linking to opens in:\n- the same window, your user may lose their place
    in the information flow\n- a different window, your user may find it difficult
    to navigate back to your site\n\n\nUse this to consider how and where to position
    your links.\n\n\n### Lists\n#### Bullet lists\nUse bullet points to break up a
    list of things. It’s easier to read and understand.\n\nBullets must:\n- use a
    lead-in line\n- make sense running on from the lead-in line\n- use lower case
    at the start of the bullet\n- have only one sentence per bullet point, use commas,
    dashes or semicolons to expand on an item\n\nBullets should not:\n- be paragraphs
    masquerading as a list for a visual effect\n- use a full stop after the last bullet
    point\n- include ‘or’ or an ‘and’ after the bullets\n\nExample\nThe meeting agenda
    will be:\n- an overview of the last month\n- a presentation\n- a special announcement\n\n\n####
    Numbered lists\nUse a numbered list for a logical sequence of things, like a series
    of tasks that must be done in a certain order. They do not need a lead-in line
    and should be complete sentences that start with a capital letter and end with
    a full stop.\n\nExample\nHow to put your shoes on:\n1. Put on socks.\n2. Put on
    shoes.\n3. Tie laces.\n\n### local causes\n \n### Local Community Fund\n \n###
    local community\n\n### log in\nPeople log in to websites, they do not log on.\nIf
    they can use a website without logging in, say ‘visit the website’.\n \n \n##
    [M](#m)\n \n### Measurements\nsq m, sq ft, cm, m, km\nAbbreviate measurements
    and use metric where possible.\nDo not abbreviate imperial measurements, use ‘miles’
    or ‘inches’ for example.\n \n### membership\nUse a capital M when referencing
    Co-op Membership or Co-op Members, but lowercase everywhere else.\n \n### Co-op
    Membership\n\nCo-op Membership card\n\nmembership\n\nmembership card\n\nmembership
    card number\n\ntemporary card\n\nmembership number\n\nmembership account\n\nCo-op
    Member\n\nmember\n\ncolleague member\n\npartner member\n\nshare of profits\n\nco-owner\n\n5%
    back\n\n1% for your community\n\n1% for your local cause\n\n### Money\nUse the
    £ symbol, for example £75.\n\nCurrencies are lower case.\n\nWrite out pence in
    full, so ‘calls will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline’.\n\nDo not use decimals
    unless pence are included, so £75.50 but not £75.00.\n\nCheck the advice about
    numbers for amounts over 1,000.\n\n\n## [N](#n)\n \n### Numbers\nWrite out ‘one’
    in full, then use numerals for all other numbers. If a sentence starts with a
    number, you should spell it out. For example, ‘Thirty-four sentences started with
    a number’.\n\nAbbreviate millions and billions when you’re writing about money,
    so ‘£23m’ or ‘£4bn’.\n\nA billion is a thousand million.\n \nWhen you’re not talking
    about money, spell out millions and billions, so ‘2 billion people’.\n \nUse commas
    for numbers over 999, so 1,000 or 5,000,000.\n \nPlurals do not need apostrophes,
    so write ‘70s’ or ‘1,000s’ not ‘70’s’ or ‘1,000’s’.\n \nWrite fractions out in
    full, so ‘half’ or ‘three quarters’, except in recipes where you should use numbers
    such as ‘½ tsp’.\n\nWrite out first, second and so on.\nSpell out ‘first’ to ‘ninth’.
    After that use 10th, 11th and so on.\nBut, write dates as 10 January 2017.\n \n###
    Phone numbers\nUse the BT code and split numbers as follows 0161 123 4567. For
    London numbers the split is 020 7123 4567.\n \nMobile numbers are split 07765
    123 456. You must include information about call charges and opening times if
    you mention a mobile number.\n \n\n## [O](#o)\n \n### Oven temperatures\nListed
    as follows:\n180°C/fan 160°C/Gas 4\nNo need to convert to Fahrenheit, except on
    food packaging where it can be shown if a supplier provides it.\n \n\n## [P](#p)\n
    \n### %\nUse % instead of ‘percent’ or ‘per cent’, it’s easier to read and understand.\n
    \n### Pronouns\nWhen talking about Co-op, use ‘we’ or ‘our’, and when talking
    to a member or customer, use ‘you’ and ‘your’.\n\n### Property\nThe Property team
    is responsible for buying, selling and looking after the Co-op’s 6,000 buildings
    across the UK. It’s not called Estates or Estates Services any more. \n\n### Common
    property terms\nCommercial property\n\nFor trading businesses like food stores,
    funeral homes, depots and offices.\n\n### Residential property\nWhere people live,
    like flats and houses.\n\n### Facilities Management (FM)\nThink about shortening
    this to ‘facilities’ if it’s what someone would say in natural speech.\n\n###
    National Operations Centre (NOC)\nThe outsourced call centre that handles all
    facilities management enquiries. Think about saying ‘call facilities’ for clarity.\n\n###
    Protected designation of origin (PDO)\nThe official names of certain products
    are protected and they must be capitalised in the correct way. For example Melton
    Mowbray pork pies and Cornish pasties.\n \n \n## [R](#r)\n \n### Rochdale Pioneers\n
    \n### Royal London\nWe put all of the money from each funeral plan into an individual
    whole of life insurance policy with Royal London. When we say Royal London, this
    is The Royal London Mutual Insurance Society Limited.\n \n\n## [S](#s)\n \n###
    seasons\nDo not capitalise winter, spring, summer or autumn.\n\n### serving suggestion\n\n###
    Slashes /\nDo not use forward slashes except in web addresses. They make content
    harder to read. Use ‘or’ instead.\n \n### Staff\nWe do not call people who work
    at Co-op ‘staff’. Internally, we use ‘colleague’ and if we’re talking to customers
    we use ‘team member’ or ‘member of our team’.\n\n### Stores\nCall the places where
    we sell our products ‘stores’, not ‘shops’.\n\n\n## [T](#t)\n \n### Time\nUse
    the 12 hour clock, so ‘9am to 5pm’. If you need to include the minutes, write
    ‘9.15am’.\n \nUse ‘midday’ rather than noon, 12noon or 12pm. Use ‘midnight’ and
    not ‘12am’. But be careful that it’s not misleading. \n\nFor example, if you said:\n‘Please
    complete and send your application form by 6 July 2018, at midnight’\n\nThen your
    user might wonder if you meant ‘ 6 July 2018, 11.59pm’ or ‘5 July 2018, 11.59pm’\n\nTo
    avoid this confusion, consider using ‘11.59pm’ where possible.\n\nIt’s not necessary
    to specify time zones, such as ‘1pm GMT’.\n\n\n### Titles\nTitles of pages and
    sub-headers should:\n- be sentence case\n- be unique, clear and descriptive \n-
    be front-loaded with key words if possible — people tend to scan the first couple
    of words only\n- use words you know your users actually use\n- be active where
    possible, ‘Apply for…’, ‘Report…’, ‘Find…’\n- not use acronyms unless they are
    well-known, like EU or BBC\n \n \n## [W](#w)\n \n### Watchout words\nWhen describing
    food, avoid the following words and phrases, unless you can qualify them:\n\nCraft\n\nFarm
    fresh\n\nNew (unless the product really is new)\n\nNatural\n\nHealthy/Healthier\n\nHomegrown\n\nLocal
    (can be used if the product is made within 30 miles)\n\nLower price (unless you
    have a higher price for comparison)\n\nReduced fat\n\nWholesome\n\nAuthentic\n\nHand
    made\n\nOriginal\n\nFresh\n\nTraditional\n \n### Websites\nDo not use the prefix
    ‘http://www.’ when writing a website address. For example, write coop.co.uk\n
    \n### Will/will\nCapitalise when talking about a specific product, lower case
    when speaking generally about wills.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
