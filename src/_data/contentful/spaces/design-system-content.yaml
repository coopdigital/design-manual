  title: Content design style guide
  introduction: |-
    We write content for the user, not for us.

    So, we design content to give users what they need:

    - only when they need it
    - as simply and quickly as possible
    - using words they understand
    - in a consistent way
    - We design in context.

    Designing content that puts our users first makes it easier and faster for them to use our services, encourages them to interact with us again and builds trust in what weâ€™re saying.

    if it's essential: design with purpose.\n\nIf it is, and you can justify the reason
    you're asking:\n\n- ask for a â€˜Full nameâ€™ in one field\n- make no assumptions
    about how the user wants to be addressed â€” ask them\n- make it explicit whose
    name weâ€™re asking for â€” include who the other person is if youâ€™re capturing multiple
    names in one form, for example, â€˜Your childâ€™s full nameâ€™\n- give an accurate instruction
    if the name needs to be written as it appears on another document, for example,
    â€˜Copy the name from your passportâ€™\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"column
    large-8\">\n    <h3 class=\"example-heading\"><span class=\"example_label\">Example</span></h3>\n
    \   <div class=\"example example--padded\">\n      <div class=\"form-row\">\n
    \       <label for=\"full-name\">Full name</label>\n        <input id=\"full-name\"

    childâ€™s full name</label>\n        <input id=\"childs-full-name\" type=\"text\">\n
    \     </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nIf you you have to capture name
    in separate fields, perhaps because of a legacy system, use:\n\n- â€˜First name
    or namesâ€™, â€˜Middle nameâ€™ (if necessary) and â€˜Last nameâ€™\n- a free text box if
    you have to ask for title\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"column large-12\">\n

    [Brackets ('parentheses')](#brackets) \n### Round brackets\nUse round brackets
    to:\n\n- clarify an acronym or technical term that youâ€™ll use from that point
    onwards, for example: â€˜Customer team member (CTM)â€™, or â€˜the people you want to
    sort out your will (known as 'executors')'\n- include supplementary information
    thatâ€™s not essential to the main point of your sentence â€“ information that, if
    removed, would not change the meaning of the sentence\n\nDo not use round brackets
    to indicate that something can be singular or plural, like:\n\nâ€˜Check which document(s)
    you need to send to HRâ€™\n\nInstead, use the plural, as this will cover each possibility:
    â€˜Check which documents you need to send to HR .â€™\n\n(A complete sentence that
    stands alone in parentheses starts with a capital letter and ends with a full
    stop before the closing bracket.)'\n\nTry not to overuse brackets, they can disrupt
    the flow of reading.\n\n### Square brackets\nOnly use square brackets to when
    you need to add clarification to a quote or something you've not written yourself,
    like:\n\n\"It [content] deserves our full time and attention\".\n\n\nBrackets
    ('parentheses')\nRound brackets\nUse round brackets to:\n\nclarify an acronym

    not written yourself, like:\n\n\"It [content] deserves our full time and attention\"\n\n##
    [Using Co-op](#using-co-op) \nRefer to Coâ€‘op as a noun in writing as â€˜Coâ€‘opâ€™,
    and not (where possible/practical) as â€˜the Coâ€‘opâ€™.\n\nWe know that users tend
    to refer to our food stores as â€˜the Coâ€‘opâ€™, so dropping the â€˜theâ€™ avoids any confusion.\n\nMake
    sure you use a non-breaking hyphen using &#8209;. This will ensure the word â€˜Coâ€‘opâ€™
    does not break when it appears at the end of a line.\n\nRefer to our business
    units as Coâ€‘op Funeralcare, Coâ€‘op Digital etc. (Two words, both capitalised.)\n\nWhen
    we're talking about our organisation in terms of what we do, it's fine to use
    Coâ€‘op as an adjective, as in 'Coâ€‘op values'.\n\nNo need to capitalise 'Coâ€‘operative'
    when it appears as an adjective or a noun unless you are referring to the Coâ€‘operative
    Group.\n\nHowever, do not talk about 'the Group' to an external audience. It doesn't
    mean anything to anyone outside Coâ€‘op.\n\nUsing 'our' as in 'our Coâ€‘op' can be
    powerful but use with caution - is it clear who 'our' is? Will 'our' mean the
    same thing to your reader as it does to you? Itâ€™s more suited to an internal audience.\n\n'Coâ€‘operative'
    and â€˜Coâ€‘opâ€™ are always hyphenated.\n\nThe only exception to this rule is on social
    media when using a hashtag such as #TheCoopWay or #BeingCoop.\n\n## [Dates and
    times](#dates-and-times)\nThe following guidance on dates and times is taken from
    gov.uk:\n\n### Dates\nAs a general rule, dates should be capitalised and written
    out in full like this:\n\nâ€˜1 January 2018â€™\n\nBut if youâ€™re limited with space,
    such as creating a table, then â€˜Janâ€™, â€˜Febâ€™ and so on is fine.\n\nDon't use ordinal
    numbers for dates like 10th, 1st and so on. It's easy to get wrong and uses more
    characters.\n\nIf youâ€™re referring to date ranges, then use â€˜toâ€™ rather than hyphens,
    en rules or em dashes.\n\nIt should look like this: January to March\n\nAvoid
    all references to annual quarters. Instead, write the dates in full:\n\nâ€˜This
    offer is valid between 1 October 2018 and 31 December 2018.â€™\n\n### Times\nUse
    the 12 hour clock. Itâ€™s easier to understand and helps avoids confusion:\n\nâ€˜Monday
    to Friday, 9am to 5pm.â€™\n\nIf you need to include minutes, write it like this:\n\nâ€˜9.15amâ€™\n\nUse
    â€˜middayâ€™ rather than noon, 12noon, or 12pm.\n\nFor example: â€˜This store closes
    24 December, midday.â€™\n\nUse â€˜midnightâ€™ rather 12am, but be careful that itâ€™s
    not misleading. For example, if I said:\n\nâ€˜Please complete and send your application
    form by 6 July 2018, at midnightâ€™\n\nThen you might wonder if I meant â€˜ 6 July
    2018, 11.59pmâ€™ or â€˜5 July 2018, 11.59pmâ€™\n\nTo avoid this confusion, consider
    using â€˜11.59pmâ€™ where possible.\n\nItâ€™s not necessary to specify time zones, such
    as â€˜1pm GMTâ€™.\n\n## [Colons and semicolons](#colons-and-semicolons)\nUse a colon
    at the end of a lead-in line to a bulleted list, for example:\n\nYou need to bring:\n\n-
    your driving licence or passport\n- a copy of your P60\n- something else\n\nIf
    you use a colon to continue or explain an idea that you mention before the colon,
    consider whether it would be better to have 2 sentences or an em dash.\n\nAvoid
    using semicolons â€” they can make sentences long and hard-to-read. If you think
    a sentence needs a semicolon, break it into separate sentences.\n\n## [Ellipsis
    (â€¦)](ellipsis)\n\nEllipsis are 3 dots that should only be used when:\n\n- youâ€™re
    quoting someone and need to show words have been missed out â€” only do this is
    the meaning will not be changed, for example: â€œWe're building things that are
    user-centricâ€¦ doing the hard work centrally to make things clearer, simpler and
    quicker.\"\n- to indicate there's more to come, for example, in a header: 'We
    asked our users to name a wineâ€¦â€™\n\nIf you use ellipsis, use 3 dots only. They
    should follow straight on after the previous word (with no space), and have one
    space after.\n\nIf the ellipsis ends the sentence, do not add an additional full
    stop.\n\nIf youâ€™re putting an ellipsis in html use &hellip;.\n\n\n## [Frequently
    asked questions (FAQs)](#faqs)\n\nDo not use FAQs.\n\nInstead, if you know that
    you are answering a genuine frequently asked question, restructure your content
    so that the answers form part of the main user journey. And put the information
    in a logical place in that journey.\n\nWe do not use FAQs because:\n\n- users
    do not know if their question has been frequently asked\n- they're often made
    up by the business rather than genuinely asked by the public\n- users have to
    navigate through irrelevant content to see if their question is there â€” itâ€™s frustrating
    and wastes their time\n- we should be creating services that speak for themselves:
    [we design with purpose](https://coop-design-manual.herokuapp.com/principles.html#purpose)\n-
    \nFor more information read [Content Strategist Sarah Richards' blog on FAQs](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/07/25/faqs-why-we-dont-have-them/).\n\n##
    [Hyphens and dashes](hyphens-and-dashes)\n\nWhat youâ€™re writing will determine
    where and when you should use hyphens and dashes.\n\nHyphens (the character you
    get when you type â€˜-â€™ ) should be used to link words or part of words â€” they show
    the user that thereâ€™s a connection between them, for example, â€˜mother-in-lawâ€™,
    â€˜fine-tunedâ€™, â€˜Coâ€‘opâ€™.\n\nEn dashes (&ndash;) should be used for connecting things
    that are related to each other by distance such as Juneâ€“July.\n\nEm dashes (&mdash;)
    can be used in pairs like parenthesis â€” that is, to enclose a word, or a phrase
    â€” or they can be used alone to detach one end of a sentence from the main body.\n\n##
    [Job titles](job-titles)\nShould only be capitalised when associated with a name
    - otherwise lower case.\n\nFor example: Chief Executive Mary Smith, a boatload
    of chief executives.\n\n## [Links](links)\n\nA link should be descriptive of the
    place it's taking the user. Do not use text such as â€˜click hereâ€™, or anything
    that does not make sense when read out of context â€” screen readers can read link
    text in isolation without the surrounding content.\n\nLink text must:\n\n- tell
    the user where itâ€™s taking them\n- be action orientated, for example, â€˜Chooseâ€¦â€™,
    â€˜Findâ€¦â€™, â€˜Discoverâ€¦â€™\n- not include a title tag â€” this accessibility feature is
    not used any more as itâ€™s not that helpful for visually impaired people\n- tell
    the user if theyâ€™re leaving our site, for example, â€˜For more information visit
    [www.citizensadvice.org.uk](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk)â€™\n- use a full
    url if itâ€™s clean (no symbols), short and potentially easy to remember (max one
    / ) for example: [bbc.co.uk/sport](https://bbc.co.uk/sport) â€” otherwise, if thereâ€™s
    a complex url, use a â€˜wordâ€™ link\n\nWhen you are linking to another page or an
    external site, think about your userâ€˜s onward journey. If the page youâ€™re linking
    to opens in:\n\n- the same window, your user may lose their place in the information
    flow\n- a different window, your user may find it difficult to navigate back to
    your site\n- Use this to consider how and where to position your links.\n\n##
    [Lists](lists)\n### Bullet lists\n\nBullets must:\n\n- use a lead-in line\n- make
    sense running on from the lead-in line\n- use lower case at the start of the bullet\n-
    have only one sentence per bullet point â€” use commas, dashes or semicolons to
    expand on an item\n\nBullets should not:\n\n- be paragraphs masquerading as a
    list for a visual effect\n- use a full stop after the last bullet point\n- include
    â€˜orâ€™ or an â€˜andâ€™ after the bullets\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"column
    medium-7 small-12\">\n    <h3 class=\"example-heading\"><span class=\"example_label\">Example</span></h3>\n
    \   <div class=\"example example--padded\">\n      <h4>The meeting agenda will
    be:</h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li>an overview of the last month</li>\n        <li>a
    presentation</li>\n        <li>a special announcement</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n
    \ </div>\n</div>\n\n\n### Numbered lists\n\nUse a numbered list for a logical
    sequence of things, like a series of tasks that must be done in a certain order.
    They do not need a lead-in line and should be complete sentences that start with
    a capital letter and end with a full stop.\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"column
    medium-7 small-12\">\n    <h3 class=\"example-heading\"><span class=\"example_label\">Example</span></h3>\n
    \   <div class=\"example example--padded\">\n      <h4>How to put your shoes on:</h4>\n
    \     <ol>\n        <li>Put on socks.</li>\n        <li>Put on shoes.</li>\n        <li>Tie
    laces.</li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n## [Money](money)\n\nUse
    the Â£ symbol: Â£75\n\nCurrencies are lower case.\n\nWrite out pence in full: calls
    will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline.\n\nDonâ€™t use decimals unless pence
    are included: Â£75.50 but not Â£75.00\n\nCheck the advice about numbers and units
    for amounts over 1,000.\n\n## [Numbers and units](numbers-and-units)\n\nUse â€˜oneâ€™
    unless youâ€™re talking about a step, a point in a list or another situation where
    using the numeral makes more sense.\n\nWrite all numbers in numerals (including
    2 to 9) except where itâ€™s part of a common expression and it would look strange,
    like â€˜one or two of themâ€™.\n\nIf a number starts a sentence, write it out in full
    (â€˜Thirty-four hula-hoops found in researcherâ€™s filing cupboardâ€™) except where
    it starts a title or subheading.\n\nFor numerals over 999, insert a comma for
    clarity. For example, â€˜It was over 1,000â€™.\n\nSpell out common fractions, such
    as one-half.\n\nUse a % sign for percentages: 50%, not â€˜pcâ€™ or â€˜percentâ€™.\n\nUse
    a 0 where thereâ€™s no digit before the decimal point.\n\nIn tables, use numerals
    throughout (not written numbers).\n\nFor big numbers use â€˜millionâ€™, â€˜billionâ€™
    and so on, written without a space after the number â€” for example, Â£3.5million.\n\n###
    Ordinal numbers: first, second and so on\n\nSpell out 'first' to 'ninth'. After
    that use 10th, 11th and so on.\n\nBut, write dates as 10 January 2017.\n\n###
    Units\n\nUse MB not KB for anything over 1MB, for example 4.09MB not 4096KB.\n\nFor
    anything under 1MB, use KB, for example, 569KB not 0.55MB.\n\nKeep units as accurate
    as possible and up to 2 decimal places. For example, 4.03MB.\n\n## [Dates and
    times](dates-and-times)\nThe following guidance on dates and times is taken from
    gov.uk:\n\n### Dates\n\nAs a general rule, dates should be capitalised and written
    out in full like this:\n\nâ€˜1 January 2018â€™\n\nBut if youâ€™re limited with space,

    itâ€™s not misleading. For example, if I said:\n\nâ€˜Please complete and send your
    application form by 6 July 2018, at midnightâ€™\n\nThen you might wonder if I meant
    â€˜ 6 July 2018, 11.59pmâ€™ or â€˜5 July 2018, 11.59pmâ€™\n\nTo avoid this confusion,
    consider using â€˜11.59pmâ€™ where possible.\n\nItâ€™s not necessary to specify time
    zones, such as â€˜1pm GMTâ€™.\n\n## [Phone numbers](phone-numbers)\n\nShow a mobile
    phone number like this: 08765 555 333.\n\nShow a UK landline number like this:
    0161 000 0000 or 01524 000 000.\n\nShow an overseas number as you'd dial it from
    the UK, so no + or (0): 00 353 1 222 3333.\n\nRemember:\n- include call charges\n-
    include opening hours\n- make sure phone numbers are usable from mobiles\n\n##
    [Titles](titles)\n\nTitles should:\n- be sentence case\n- be less than 65 characters
    within HTML document titles â€” Google cuts them off after this\n- be unique, clear
    and descriptive â€” no puns or single topic words\n- be front-loaded with key words
    if possible â€” people tend to scan the first couple of words only\n- use words
    you know your users actually search for\n- be active where possible, â€˜Apply forâ€¦â€™,
    â€˜Reportâ€¦â€™, â€˜Findâ€¦â€™\n- not use acronyms unless they are well-known, like EU, BBC.\n\n##
    [Validation messages](validation-messages)\n\nValidation messages must:\n\n- be
    flagged at the top of the screen and at each relevant field\n- be a bulleted list
    if thereâ€™s more than one error\n- be a complete sentence if thereâ€™s only one error
    (no bullet)\n- be linked from the top of the page to take users to the relevant
    field\n- help the user fix the problem, for example, â€˜Check you've entered the
    correct sort code â€” itâ€™s the 6 digit number usually found on your bank cardâ€™\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
