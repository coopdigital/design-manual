            <p class="intro-text">The Co-op is committed to be an inclusive organisation, and as a result we should always aim to provide fully accessible&nbsp;services.</p>

        <div class="column medium-7 small-12">
            <p>When designing and buliding a service for Co-op make sure to test with users of all levels of ability. There are many automated testing tools you can use to check accessibility but these should never be seen as an alternative to testing with real people. We do provide some guidance on accessibility within the design patterns (for instance our <a href="http://localhost:9000/front-end-elements/colours.html#text-colours">colour contrast ratio guidelines</a>) and will in the future expand this section to include many more.</p>
            <p>We always try to make everything we design and build accessible to all. <strong>If you are aware of any ways that we could improve please <a href="/feedback.html">let us know</a></strong>. We are always grateful for your feedback.</p>
