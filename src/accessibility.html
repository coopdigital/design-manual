    <p>The Co-op adheres to the <abbr title="Royal National Institute of Blind People">RNIB</abbr> ‘Surf Right’ standards welcoming all visitors, regardless of any disability or technology needs. The following content is not an exhaustive list of the ‘Surf Right’ standards but highlights some key areas to consider.</p>

    <p>Web accessibility is about making your website accessible to all internet users (both disabled and non-disabled), regardless of what browsing technology they’re using. Producing an accessible website can reap huge benefits across all of our businesses and can help make our sites more usable and stronger for <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>.</p>

    <p>Accessibility should be thought of as an integral part of every single project, and should be considered as more than a box-ticking exercise.</p>

    <p>However, as a baseline, we should aim for all digital content to meet the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/?levels=aaa">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA</a>.</p>
