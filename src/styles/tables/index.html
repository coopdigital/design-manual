                <p>Tables are a helpful way of organising information, but there are times when they are not suitable. For example, if a table only has one column it should be a bullet list instead. Be clear about the question your table is answering, and make sure everyone will find it easy to use and understand.</p>

                </a>
                <p>There are different approaches you can take when making a table, depending on the type and amount of information you are presenting. This isn’t an exhaustive list of patterns. We’re still exploring what works and what doesn’t, so please share examples and research.</p>
