                    <p>Form patterns are ways to solve commonly occurring problems. They can be reusable both within a single form (for example, validation messages) and across different forms (asking for name, address and so on).</p>

                <p>The format of people’s names can vary. Some do not fit into conventional UK formats. It can be unnecessary and uncomfortable for users to define themselves using a title, or a separate first name — surname format.</p>

                <h3>Asking for gender and sex</h3>
                <p>Do not ask unless you can justify why you're asking.</p>
                <p>As with gathering a ‘title’, some users may feel uneasy giving this information.</p>
                <p>If you’re gathering information to use to address the user later, ask what pronoun they prefer - he/him, she/her, they/them. See <a href="http:/techland.time.com/2014/02/14/a-comprehensive-guide-to-facebooks-new-options-for-gender-identity/">how Facebook offers gender options</a>.</p>
                <p>If you do need to know, ask about a person’s ‘gender’, not their sex. Allow them to tell us in their own words with a text entry field.</p>
                <p>But ultimately - if you do not need to know - do not ask.</p>

                    <p>You might need to ask for addresses when you:</p>

                      <li>want to send correspondence</li>
                      <li>want to deliver something</li>

                      <li>need to know for identity purposes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For many people these are the same address, but for some they could be different addresses. Make it clear to users from the start what you’re going to do with that information.</p>

                    <p>Use the length of the text input field to indicate the format. If research shows that more clarification is needed, use hint text (static text that sits outside of the text entry field) rather than placeholder text (text that sits within the text entry field).</p>
                    <p>Do not auto tab between fields — this can be unnerving for some users and can make it difficult to edit mistakes.</p>
