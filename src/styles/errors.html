            <p>It doesn’t matter whether they’ve misspelled a URL or we’re carrying out maintenance on our end (like a 503 error). The message should be succinct, reassuring and useful.</p>

                <h2>404 page not found</h2>
                <p>Users see a 404 page when they follow a broken link; from another website, from our website, from search results, by mistyping a url or following a link to a page that we’ve moved or deleted. It’s a frustrating experience for more confident users, and troubling for the less experienced.</p>
                <p>A good 404 page:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reassures the user</li>
                    <li>helps them get back on track</li>
                    <li>doesn’t make them feel as though they’ve done something wrong</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Basic 404 page</h3>

                <h4>Make a guess about what the user might have been looking for</h4>
                <p>Add some code to your 404 page that displays a url, taking common misspellings into account.</p>

                <p>Page content: Were you looking for this page? [show the whole url]</p>
                <h4>Use custom messages that reflect how the user arrived at the 404 page</h4>
                <p>Show a message that tells the user in more detail what has happened. In some cases, we can even take the opportunity to thank them for making us aware of a problem.</p>
                <p>Use these custom messages for the following scenarios:</p>
                <h4>Mistyped URL or out-of-date bookmark</h4>
                <p>Page content: There isn’t a page at this address. Try searching for the page you were looking for or go back to the [service] home page.</p>
                <h4>Broken link on one of our pages</h4>
                <p>Page content: Thank you for finding a broken link on our website. We’ll fix it as soon as we can. In the meantime, try searching for the page you were looking for or go back to the [service]home page.</p>
                <h4>Broken link on somebody else’s website</h4>
                <p>Page content: It looks like you followed a broken link to our website. We’ll try and let the owner of that website know about this problem. In the meantime, try searching for the page you were looking for or go back to the [service] home page.</p>
                <h4>Broken link from search results</h4>
                <p>Page content: Thank you for finding a broken link to our website. We’ll fix it as soon as we can. In the meantime, try searching for the page you were looking for or go back to the [service] home page.</p>
