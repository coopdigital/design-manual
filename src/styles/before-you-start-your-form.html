        <h1>Before you start your form</h1>
        <h2 id="know-why">Know why you’re asking each question and what it’s needed for</h2>
        <p>Before you ask a user to answer a question, make sure that you know exactly how you will use the answer and why the answer is necessary for the service. If it’s not necessary, do not ask. The more you ask of the user, the more effort it takes them and the more likely they are to drop out of the service.</p>
        <h2 id="tell-users" class="section-title">Tell users why we’re asking</h2>
        <p>When you ask for information tell users why we are asking for it and what we’ll do with it. This will not only increase trust but can affect the answer a user gives. For example, asking someone for an address to verify who they are,  and asking for an address to deliver something to, could result in different responses from the user.</p>

        <h2 id="simple-language" class="section-title">Use simple, direct language</h2>
        <p>Do not burden a user with new terminology and concepts if you can avoid it. It increases the effort it takes the user to get through the form, and makes it more likely that they’ll stop using it and go elsewhere.</p>
        <p>If the answer the user needs to give relies on their understanding of a complex concept, you must explain in plain English [wills executor example?].  Do not assume any prior knowledge of the subject you’re writing about. Do not assume a certain level of literacy, education or digital experience. <a href="/principles.html#everyone#">Design for everyone</a></p>
        <p>Even if you’re writing for a specialist audience, <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/02/17/guest-post-clarity-is-king-the-evidence-that-reveals-the-desperate-need-to-re-think-the-way-we-write/" target="_blank">research shows that the higher the level of expertise the greater the preference for plain English.</a></p>
        <p>Content that’s easy to understand benefits everyone.</p>
        <h2 id="give-context" class="section-title">Give information in context</h2>
       <p>Content should be timely: given at the point it’s needed. Think about the most effective place for your user to get information.</p>
       <p>Do not give information within a form that:
       <ul>
         <li>a user needs to refer to at a later date</li>
         <li>disturbs the task the user is completing, for example, including a link that takes the user away</li>
         <li>would be more timely, relevant or effective through a different channel</li>
       </ul>
       </p>
        <h2 id="get-context" class="section-title">Get information in context</h2>
        <p>If the user needs to understand complex information in order to answer a question, give that information at the point it’s needed.  Allow users to easily refer back to it, re-read it or skip to parts they’re unsure of.  Consider users who have short term memory, cognitive problems or are in a distracting environment — don’t expect complex information to be retained easily or for a long time. Make complex questions as easy as possible for your users to answer. <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/tag/joanne-schofield/" target="_blank">See how the Wills Team tried to make writing a will less daunting.</a></p>
        <p>And let users focus — only deal with one concept per page.</p>
        <h2 id="set-exectations" class="section-title">Set expectations</h2>
        <p>Tell users what’s expected of them before they start the form. It will reduce frustration and make it less likely that they’ll drop out of the transaction.</p>
        <p>Tell users upfront:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>what the service is</li>
            <li>what the eligibility is</li>
            <li>what information they need which they may not have immediately to hand</li>
            <li>any related costs or commitments</li>
            <li>any other essential information that may affect their decision to use your service</li>
        </ul>
