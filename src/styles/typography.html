                <p>We have a typographic scale to create clear structure and coherence for readers. We have a recommended scale for larger and smaller devices, but you can add more breakpoints and sizes in the code to suit your user needs.</p>

                    <p>&lsquo;Just as regular use of time provides rhythm in music, so regular use of space provides rhythm in typography, and without rhythm the listener, or the reader, becomes disorientated and lost.&rsquo;</p>

                <p>All of our spacing between lines, paragraphs and headings is in multiples of 8px.

This baseline allows us to space our text, images or any other page elements consistently.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>&lsquo;Anything from 45 to 75 characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory length of line for a single-column page set in a serifed text face in a text size. The 66-character line (counting both letters and spaces) is widely regarded as ideal. For multiple column work, a better average is 40 to 50 characters.&rsquo;</p>
