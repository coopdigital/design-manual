            <p>When you're building a Co-op digital service, have a look in this design manual to find:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>how to write good content</li>
                <li>the building blocks of design such as interaction design patterns</li>
                <li>the conventions we use for front-end development</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some of the advice is here because we've researched it and know it works. Other parts are our current best guess. Other parts are missing entirely because we don't know yet.</p>
