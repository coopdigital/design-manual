            <p>Communicating with a clear voice, at the right time, in the right&nbsp;way.</p>

            <p>There’s no substitute for putting our work in front of real people - people change, and what we build should change with&nbsp;them.</p>
            <p>We do this by:</p>

                <li>learning, building, measuring&nbsp;(repeat)</li>
                <li>learning from what people do, not what they say they&nbsp;do</li>
