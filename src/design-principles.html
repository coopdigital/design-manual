            <p>Communicating with a clear voice, at the right time, in the right&nbsp;way.</p>
            <p>We do this by:</p>

            <p>Designing services that are useful, elegant and easy to use.</p>
            <p>We do this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>knowing why the service is needed before we build&nbsp;it</li>
                <li>getting out of the way - helping users achieve their goals as quickly as they&nbsp;can</li>

            <p>People come to our services with their own needs, insecurities and struggles – they deserve our consideration and&nbsp;thoughtfulness.</p>
            <p>We do this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>designing so that no one feels&nbsp;different</li>
                <li>communicating in a clear, simple way: opening up our services to&nbsp;everyone</li>

                <li>being true to our medium, understanding its opportunities and&nbsp;limits</li>

                <li>talking about what we’re making as we make&nbsp;it</li>
                <li>being generous with our knowledge, and being open to learn from&nbsp;others</li>

            <p>There’s no substitute for putting our work in front of real people - people change, and what we build should change with&nbsp;them.</p>
            <p>We do this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>learning, building, measuring&nbsp;(repeat)</li>
                <li>learning from what people do, not what they say they&nbsp;do</li>
                <li>not letting imperfections stop us from releasing - this is how we learn and&nbsp;improve</li>
