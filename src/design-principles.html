    <h1>Design principles</h1>
    <p class="margin-bb">We design for users by following these principles.</p>

        <div class="column medium-6 small-12">
            <h2>We design in context</h2>
            <p>We communicate with a clear voice, at the right time, in the right&nbsp;way.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look at the whole experience, not only the digital bit</li>
                <li>Give information only at the point it’s needed, and through the best channel</li>
                <li>Understand user needs, the market, technology and our business goals</li>

            <h2>We design with purpose</h2>
            <p>Before we build a thing, we know why it’s needed and how we’ll know if it’s&nbsp;effective.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make services that are simple, useful and elegant</li>
                <li>Help users achieve their goal; remove distractions</li>
                <li>Design things that speak for themselves</li>

        <div class="column medium-6 small-12">
            <h2>We design for everyone</h2>
            <p>People come to our services with their own needs, insecurities and struggles – they deserve our consideration and&nbsp;thoughtfulness.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t design for difference, design so that no one feels different</li>
                <li>Write in a clear, simple way; open up your service to everyone</li>

            <h2>We design with honesty</h2>
            <p>We’re truthful about what we can and can’t do for our&nbsp;users.</p>

                <li>Nothing made up</li>
                <li>Talk about what we’ve done</li>
                <li>Be true to your medium, understand its opportunities and limits: what works on paper won’t always work on&nbsp;screen</li>
                <li>Be deliberate in what, when and how you communicate</li>

                <li>Talk about what you’re making as you make it</li>
                <li>Be generous with your knowledge, and be ready to learn from others</li>

            <ul>
                <li>People change, and what we build should change with them</li>
                <li>Build, measure, learn (repeat)</li>
                <li>Learn from what people do, not what they say they do</li>
                <li>Don’t let imperfections stop you from releasing. This is how we learn and improve</li>
