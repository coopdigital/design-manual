                    <li>give an accurate instruction if the name needs to be written as it appears on another document, for example, ‘Copy the name from your passport’</li>

                <h2>Using Co&#8209;op</h2>
                <p>Refer to Co&#8209;op as a noun in writing as &lsquo;Co&#8209;op&rsquo;, and not (where possible/practical) as &lsquo;the Co&#8209;op&rsquo;.</p>
                <p>We know that users tend to refer to our food stores as &lsquo;the Co&#8209;op&rsquo;, so dropping the &lsquo;the&rsquo; avoids any confusion.</p>
                <p>Make sure you use a non-breaking hyphen using <code class="language-html">&amp;#8209;</code>. This will ensure the word &lsquo;Co&#8209;op&rsquo; does not break when it appears at the end of a line.</p>
                <p>Refer to our business units as Co&#8209;op Funeralcare, Co&#8209;op Digital etc. (Two words, both capitalised.)</p>
                <p>When we're talking about our organisation in terms of what we do, it's fine to use Co&#8209;op as an adjective, as in 'Co&#8209;op values'.</p>
                <p>No need to capitalise 'Co&#8209;operative' when it appears as an adjective or a noun unless you are referring to the Co&#8209;operative Group.</p>
                <p>However, do not talk about 'the Group' to an external audience. It doesn't mean anything to anyone outside Co&#8209;op.</p>
                <p>Using 'our' as in 'our Co&#8209;op' can be powerful but use with caution - is it clear who 'our' is? Will 'our' mean the same thing to your reader as it does to you? It&rsquo;s more suited to an internal audience.</p>
                <p>'Co&#8209;operative' and &lsquo;Co&#8209;op&rsquo; are always hyphenated.</p>
                <p>The only exception to this rule is on social media when using a hashtag such as #TheCoopWay or #BeingCoop.</p>

            <section id="dates-and-times" class="dm-section">
                <h2>Dates and times</h2>
                <p>The following guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#d">dates</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#t">times</a> is taken from gov.uk:</p>
                <h3>Dates</h3>
                <p>As a general rule, dates should be capitalised and written out in full like this:</p>
                <p>‘1 January 2018’</p>
                <p>But if you’re limited with space, such as creating a table, then ‘Jan’, ‘Feb’ and so on is fine.</p>
                <p>Don't use ordinal numbers for dates like 10th, 1st and so on. It's easy to get wrong and uses more characters.</p>
                <p>If you’re referring to date ranges, then use ‘to’ rather than hyphens, en rules or em dashes.</p>
                <p>It should look like this: January to March</p>
                <p>Avoid all references to annual quarters. Instead, write the dates in full:</p>
                <p>‘This offer is valid between 1 October 2018 and 31 December 2018.’</p>
                <h3>Times</h3>
                <p>Use the 12 hour clock. It’s easier to understand and helps avoids confusion:</p>
                <p>‘Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm.’</p>
                <p>If you need to include minutes, write it like this:</p>
                <p>‘9.15am’</p>
                <p>Use ‘midday’ rather than noon, 12noon, or 12pm.</p>
                <p>For example: ‘This store closes 24 December, midday.’</p>
                <p>Use ‘midnight’ rather 12am, but be careful that it’s not misleading. For example, if I said:</p>
                <p>‘Please complete and send your application form by 6 July 2018, at midnight’</p>
                <p>Then you might wonder if I meant ‘ 6 July 2018, 11.59pm’ or ‘5 July 2018, 11.59pm’</p>
                <p>To avoid this confusion, consider using ‘11.59pm’ where possible.</p>
                <p>It’s not necessary to specify time zones, such as ‘1pm GMT’.</p>

                <h2>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2>
                <p>Do not use FAQs.</p>
                <p>Instead, if you know that you are answering a genuine frequently asked question, restructure your content so that the answers form part of the main user journey. And put the information in a logical place in that journey.</p>
                <p>We do not use FAQs because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>users do not know if their question has been frequently asked</li>
                    <li>they're often made up by the business rather than genuinely asked by the public</li>
                    <li>users have to navigate through irrelevant content to see if their question is there — it’s frustrating and wastes their time</li>
                    <li>we should be creating services that speak for themselves: we <a href="/principles.html#purpose">design with purpose</a></li>

            <h2>Hyphens and dashes</h2>
                <p>What you’re writing will determine where and when you should use hyphens and dashes.</p>
                <p>Hyphens (the character you get when you type ‘-’ ) should be used to link words or part of words — they show the user that there’s a connection between them, for example, ‘mother-in-law’, ‘fine-tuned’, ‘Co&#8209;op’.</p>
                <p>En dashes (<code>&#x26;ndash;</code>) should be used for connecting things that are related to each other by distance such as June&ndash;July.</p>
                <p>Em dashes (<code>&#x26;mdash;</code>) can be used in pairs like parenthesis — that is, to enclose a word, or a phrase — or they can be used alone to detach one end of a sentence from the main body.</p>

            <section id="job-titles" class="dm-section">
              <h2>Job titles</h2>
              <p>Should only be capitalised when associated with a name - otherwise lower case.</p>
              <p>For example: Chief Executive Mary Smith, a boatload of chief executives.</p>
            </section>
                <h2>Links</h2>
                <p>A link should be descriptive of the place it's taking the user. Do not use text such as ‘click here’, or anything that does not make sense when read out of context — screen readers can read link text in isolation without the surrounding content.</p>
                <p>Link text must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>tell the user where it’s taking&nbsp;them</li>
                    <li>be action orientated, for example, ‘Choose&hellip;’, ‘Find&hellip;’,&nbsp;‘Discover&hellip;’</li>
                    <li>not include a title tag — this accessibility feature is not used any more as it’s not that helpful for visually impaired&nbsp;people</li>
                    <li>tell the user if they’re leaving our site, for example, ‘For more information visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk">www.citizensadvice.org.uk</a>’</li>
                    <li>use a full url if it’s clean (no symbols), short and potentially easy to remember (max one / ) for example: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport">bbc.co.uk/sport</a> — otherwise, if there’s a complex url, use a ‘word’&nbsp;link</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you are linking to another page or an external site, think about your user‘s onward journey. If the page you’re linking to opens&nbsp;in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the same window, your user may lose their place in the information&nbsp;flow</li>
                    <li>a different window, your user may find it difficult to navigate back to your&nbsp;site</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Use this to consider how and where to position your&nbsp;links.</p>

              <h2>Money</h2>
              <p>Use the £ symbol: £75</p>
              <p>Currencies are lower case.</p>
              <p>Write out pence in full: calls will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline.</p>
              <p>Don’t use decimals unless pence are included: £75.50 but not £75.00</p>
              <p>Check the advice about <a href="#numbers-and-units">numbers and units</a> for amounts over 1,000.</p>

                <h2>Numbers and units</h2>
                <p>Use ‘one’ unless you’re talking about a step, a point in a list or another situation where using the numeral makes more sense.</p>
                <p>Write all numbers in numerals (including 2 to 9) except where it’s part of a common expression and it would look strange, like ‘one or two of them’.</p>
                <p>If a number starts a sentence, write it out in full (‘Thirty-four hula-hoops found in researcher’s filing cupboard’) except where it starts a title or subheading.</p>
                <p>For numerals over 999, insert a comma for clarity. For example, ‘It was over 1,000’.</p>
                <p>Spell out common fractions, such as one-half.</p>
                <p>Use a % sign for percentages: 50%, not ‘pc’ or ‘percent’.</p>
                <p>Use a 0 where there’s no digit before the decimal point.</p>
                <p>In tables, use numerals throughout (not written numbers).</p>
                <p>For big numbers use ‘million’, ‘billion’ and so on, written without a space after the number — for example, £3.5million.</p>
                <h3 id="ordinal-numbers">Ordinal numbers: first, second and so on</h3>
                <p>Spell out 'first' to 'ninth'. After that use 10th, 11th and so on.</p>
                <p>But, write dates as 10 January 2017.</p>
                <h3 id="units">Units</h3>
                <p>Use MB not KB for anything over 1MB, for example 4.09MB not 4096KB.</p>
                <p>For anything under 1MB, use KB, for example, 569KB not 0.55MB.</p>
                <p>Keep units as accurate as possible and up to 2 decimal places. For example, 4.03MB.</p>
