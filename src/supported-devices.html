            <p>We aim to provide a consistent web experience across a wide variety of browser and device combinations available to our consumers. However we accept that small variations are acceptable within 'Full' and, 'Partial', support and where there are no workarounds available.</p>
            <p>We encourage the use of new technology and the use of the latest features as long as they are applied using a method that allows users not supporting (or intentional disabling) these features to access the same content.</p>
            <p>The primary browser, used for core developments, is Chrome (latest version). Once working on this browser, the rest of the supported browsers should be tested.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> IE 8, Windows Phone, Blackberry and Opera are unsupported due to low traffic levels.</p>

            <h2 id="methodology">Methodology <a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a></h2>
            <p>The support list has been created by combining and analysing the traffic to our core customer facing websites over a three month period. Whilst there are small variations in results from site to site, the variation is largely between 1-3% so an overall average provides the best summary of the browsers and devices types used by our customers.</p>
            <p>There are so many device/browser combinations in todayâ€™s market (especially when we look at how fragmented the Android market is) that we cannot confidently test every single variation. For this reason we have set thresholds for Full and Partial support. For traditional desktop/laptop combinations, Full support and Partial support is set at 3% and 1% respectively. For Mobile and tablet where there is more fragmentation and the difference in operating system can have dramatic impact on the presentation and device capability, the threshold is lowered to 2% and 1%.</p>
            <h3>Maintenance</h3>
            <p>Please note that the browser support matrix will change on a regular basis as new versions become available or the most popular browsers our customers' use changes. It is fine to support devices and browsers not listed here if your analytics show that it must be supported.</p>
            <p class="smallprint">* Browser Versions auto update without user intervention, so the Full supported version is the two most recent non-beta versions and Partial support is the third most recent non-beta version.</p>
