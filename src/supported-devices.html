        <p>We aim to provide a consistent web experience across a wide variety of browser and device combinations available to our consumers. However we accept that small variations are acceptable within the ‘levels of support’ and where there are no workarounds available.</p>

        <p>We encourage the use of new technology and the use of the latest features as long as they are applied using a method that allows users not supporting (or intentional disabling) these features to access the same content.</p>

        <p>The primary browser, used for core developments, is Chrome (latest version). Once working on this browser, the rest of the supported browsers should be tested.</p>

        <h2 id="levels-of-support">Levels of support <a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a></h2>

        <h3>Level 1 - Fully supported browsers</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>All content <strong>must</strong> be readable and usable and all functionality <strong>must</strong> work.</li>
            <li>Variations to presentation of content <strong>must</strong> be minimised.</li>
            <li>Where CSS layout is used, the CSS <strong>must</strong> be rendered by supported web browsers, so that a fully-styled version of the page is presented to the user.</li>
            <li>Pages <strong>should</strong> be developed to maximise the user experience for users of the web browser with the highest proportion of users (IE8 Windows at this time).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level 2 - Partially supported browsers</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>All core content <strong>must</strong> be readable and usable and the navigation <strong>must</strong> work.</li>
            <li>Any degradation to functionality <strong>must</strong> be graceful degradation.</li>
            <li>Any degradation to presentation <strong>must not</strong> obscure content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level 3 – Unsupported web browsers</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>No support or testing necessary</li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <p>Please note that the browser support matrix will change on a regular basis as new versions become available or the most popular browsers our customers' use changes. If you need to deviate from the browser support you should clearly state this at the beginning of the project in your brief or statement of work. Examples of when you need to deviate are when your customer base use an older browser version (i.e. not level 1) and this version needs to be a upgraded to a higher level of support (e.g Our Britannia website attracts an unusually high number of IE6 users and therefore needs to off Level 1/2 support for IE6). </p>
        <p>* Browser Versions auto update without user intervention, so the Level 1 supported version is the two most recent non-beta versions and Level 2 support is the third most recent non-beta version.</p>

        <h2 id="methodology">Methodology <a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a></h2>

        <p>The Browser &amp; Device support list has been created by combining and analysing the traffic to our core customer facing websites over a three month period. Whilst there are small variations in results from site to site, the variation is largely between 1-3% so an overall average provides the best summary of the browsers and devices types used by our customers.</p>

        <p>There are so many device/browser combinations in today’s market (especially when we look at how fragmented the Android market is) that we cannot confidently test every single variation. For this reason we have set thresholds for level 1 and level 2 support. For traditional desktop/laptop combinations level 1 support &amp; level 2 support is set at 3% and 1% respectively. For Mobile and tablet where there is more fragmentation and the difference in operating system can have dramatic impact on the presentation and device capability, the threshold is lowered to 2% and 1%.</p>
